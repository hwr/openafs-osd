/* Linux specific store operations
 *
 * The idea of these operations is to reduce the number of copies
 * that data incurs when passing from the disk cache through to the
 * RX layer, and vice versa.
 *
 * In kernels which support it, we use the splice() operation - in
 * older kernels, the filesystem's sendpage() operation is used directly.
 * Either way, this means that we can get direct access to the page contents,
 * rather than getting a copy.
