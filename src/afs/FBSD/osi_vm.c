 * FreeBSD implementation notes:
 * Most of these operations require us to frob vm_objects.  Most
 * functions require that the object be locked (with VM_OBJECT_*LOCK)
 * on entry and leave it locked on exit.  The locking protocol
 * requires that we access vp->v_object with the heavy vnode lock
 * held and the vnode interlock unlocked.
 *
 * The locking protocol for vnodes is defined in
 * kern/vnode_if.src and sys/vnode.h; unfortunately, it is not *quite*
 * constant from version to version so to be properly correct we must
 * check the VCS history of those files.
