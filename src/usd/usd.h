#ifndef OPENAFS_USD_H

/* Define I/O functions that operate on both device and regular files.
 *
 * Essentially, this is a mechanism for dealing with systems (such as NT)
 * that do not allow devices to be accessed via POSIX-equivalent
 * open()/read()/write()/close() functions.
 */

/* The Unix common code is implemented by usd/usd_file.c and the WinNT
 * code is in usd/usd_nt.c. */

/* The device handle "usd_handle_t" is returned by the function usd_Open.
 * This object includes function pointers for all the other operations,
 * which are accessed by macros, e.g. USD_READ(usd_handle_t, ...).  In
 * general, this handle is entirely opaque to outside callers.
 *
 * Because of WinNT restrictions on dealing with devices, it is not possible
 * to lock devices independently from opening them.  A flag bit is specified
 * at open time requesting a read (shared) or write (exclusive) lock or
 * neither.  The device remains locked until the handle is closed.
 *
 * An application can not open a device multiple times.  This is because on
 * WinNT the holder of the lock is the handle not the process as on Unix.
 *
 * All the "usd_" function return an error status as an "(int)" converted
 * into the errno domain, with zero meaning no error.
 *
 * As a consequence of this method of reporting errors, output values are
 * returned in reference parameters instead of being encoded in the return
 * value.  Also, offsets and lengths use the afs_int64 type. */

/* NOTE -- this module is preempt safe.  It assume it is being called from a
 *     preemptive environment.  Treat all calls as if they had an "_r"
 *     suffix. */
