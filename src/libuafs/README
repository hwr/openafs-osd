README file for libuafs, Version 1.2 06/04/2003.


### INTRODUCTION ###

This Makefile generates two libraries, the standard libuafs.a and
libuafs_pic.a, suitable for linking into shared libraries.

The libuafs.a library facilitates user authentication at a process
level and enables access and manipulation of the files and access
control lists (ACLs).  By way of the libuafs.a klog function
(uafs_klog), the authenticated user's credentials are bound to the
executing process and therefore is granted permission to act on behalf
of the authenticated user.


### LIBUAFS ###

As of 05/13/2002 the libuafs.a library remains unchanged with respect
to OpenAFS release 1.2.3.


*afs_setpag_val
A function like setpag but sets the current thread's pag id to a
caller-provided value instead of calling genpag().  This implements a
form of token caching since the caller can recall a particular pag value
for the thread to restore tokens, rather than reauthenticating.


### BUILD ###

A simple "make" will build libuafs.a and libuafs_pic.a.


### DIRECTORIES ###

The libuafs/UAFS directory is generated by the Makefile and contains the
object files and local copy of libuafs.a resulting from the build process.
The libuafs/UAFS.pic directory is the same as libuafs/UAFS, however it
contains output files respective to libuafs_pic.a.
