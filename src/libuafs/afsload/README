afsload Prerequisites:

- Text::ParseWords
- Number::Format
- Parallel::MPI::Simple (0.03)
- AFS::ukernel

Text::ParseWords
--

This comes with Perl on most systems I've tried. But if it's not on yours,
you can get with from CPAN.

Number::Format
--

This can be obtained from CPAN; nothing special required.

Parallel::MPI::Simple
--

Before you install this, you must have some MPI implementation installed. Note
that you must compile Parallel::MPI::Simple against the same MPI implementation
that you run 'afsload' against.

For OpenMPI, this involves installing the packages openmpi, openmpi-devel, and
openmpi-libs on RHEL5. For Debian Lenny, install openmpi-bin, openmpi-common,
libopenmpi1, libopenmpi-dev, and openmpi-doc if you want it.

Now, Parallel::MPI::Simple itself you can get from CPAN, but the build process
requires some massaging. Download and unpack the source tarball manually, and
build like so.

On RHEL5 with OpenMPI:

$ perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-I/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/include/ LIBS='-L/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/lib -Wl,-R/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/lib -lmpi'

On Debian:

$ perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-I/usr/include/mpi

then just 'make'/'make install' as normal.

AFS::ukernel
--

To get this, you need to build OpenAFS on a machine that has SWiG
installed. If you build as normal when SWiG is installed, the module
will show up in $sysname/dest/root.perf/lib/perl for transarc paths. You
just need to put that somewhere in perl's @INC so perl can find it. (A
couple examples are /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/ on RHEL5 and
/usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.0/ on Debian Lenny).

afsload itself
--

Copy the contents of lib/ to /usr/local/lib/afsload/perl/. The files
afsload_run.pl and afsload_check.pl should go in /usr/local/lib/afsload/. The
'afsload' script can be copied to somewhere in your PATH.

Running afsload may require setting the MPIRUN and LIBMPI environment
variables. On RHEL5 with OpenMPI, you probably want to run with the following
environment variables set:

MPIRUN=/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/bin/mpirun
LIBMPI=/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/lib/libmpi.so.0

or configure the box such that running 'mpirun' runs that mpirun, and
/usr/lib/libmpi.so points to that libmpi.so.0.
