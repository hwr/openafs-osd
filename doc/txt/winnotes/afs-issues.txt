This file is a rough list of known issues with the 1.7.01 release of OpenAFS 
on Windows.  This list is not complete.  There are probably other issues which 
can be found in the RT database or on the mailing list.

For all of these issues please review 

  http://www.openafs.org/roadmap.html

(1) File/Directory access is not integrated with windows security 

(12) AFS Integrated Logon:
(12c) If network is not available must store the username and password 
      somewhere until such time as the network starts.

(17) Named Pipes Support
     [requires modifications to AFS servers to support distributed
      named pipes but local machine named pipes could be implemented
      now that AFS has its own redirector file system driver.]

(21) There is no Management Console to use for client configuration.

(24) Compatibility with User Account Control (UAC)

(25) No support for the Volume Query Quota Interface

(26) No support for the Volume Shadow Copy Service

(27) No support for storing DOS attributes

(28) No support for Alternate Data Streams

(29) No support for Extended Attributes

(30) No support for Access Based Enumeration

(31) No support for Distributed Link Tracking and Object IDs

      privileges
         1. default cell and principal for the user
         2. drive mappings but no submounts
         3. visibility of afs creds and setting of afs creds startup options
