 Some
    cells use the Network File System (NFS) in addition to AFS. If you work on an NFS client machine, your system
    administrator can configure it to access the AFS filespace through a program called the <emphasis>NFS/AFS
    Translator</emphasis><superscript>TM</superscript>. If you have an AFS account, you can access AFS as an
    authenticated user while working on your NFS client machine. Otherwise, you access AFS as the
    <emphasis role="bold">anonymous</emphasis> user.</para>

 For you to use the NFS/AFS Translator, your system
    administrator must configure the following types of machines as indicated:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>An <emphasis>NFS/AFS translator machine</emphasis> is an AFS client machine that also acts as an
      NFS server machine. Its Cache Manager acts as the surrogate Cache Manager for your NFS client machine. Ask your
      system administrator which translator machines you can use.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Your NFS client machine must have an NFS mount to a translator machine. Most often, your system
      administrator mounts the translator machine's <emphasis role="bold">/afs</emphasis> directory and names the mount
      <emphasis role="bold">/afs</emphasis> as well. This enables you to access the entire AFS filespace using standard
      AFS pathnames. It is also possible to create mounts directly to subdirectories of
      <emphasis role="bold">/afs</emphasis>, and to give NFS mounts different names on the NFS client
      machine.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Your access to AFS is much more extensive if you have an AFS user account. If you do not, the AFS servers
    recognize you as the <emphasis role="bold">anonymous</emphasis> user and only grant you the access available to
    members of the <emphasis role="bold">system:anyuser</emphasis> group.</para>
    <para>If your NFS client machine uses an operating system that AFS supports, your system administrator can
    configure it to enable you to issue many AFS commands on the machine. Ask him or her about the configuration and
    which commands you can issue.</para>

<indexterm><primary>authentication</primary><secondary>to AFS on NFS client machines</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>If you do not have an AFS account or choose not to access AFS as an authenticated user, then all you do to
    access AFS is provide the pathname of the relevant file. Its ACL must grant the necessary permissions to the
    <emphasis role="bold">system:anyuser</emphasis> group.</para>
    <para>If you have an AFS account and want to access AFS as an authenticated user, the best method depends on
    whether your NFS machine is a supported type. If it is, use the instructions in <link linkend="HDRWQ82">To
    Authenticate on a Supported Operating System</link>. If it is not a supported type, use the instructions in
    <link linkend="HDRWQ83">To Authenticate on an Unsupported Operating System</link>.</para>

        Issue the <emphasis role="bold">knfs</emphasis> command to associate your AFS tokens
        with your UNIX UID on the NFS client machine where you are working. This enables the Cache Manager on the
        translator machine to use the tokens properly when you access AFS from the NFS client machine.
        </para><para>If your NFS client machine is a system type for which AFS defines a system name, it can make sense
        to add the <emphasis role="bold">-sysname</emphasis> argument. This argument helps the Cache Manager access
        binaries specific to your NFS client machine, if your system administrator has used the
        <emphasis>@sys</emphasis> variable in pathnames. Ask your system administrator if this argument is useful for
        you.

    <para>Acceptable performance by the NFS/AFS translator depends for the most part on NFS. Sometimes, problems that
    appear to be AFS file server outages, broken connections, or inaccessible files are actually caused by NFS
    outages.</para>
    <para>This section describes some common problems and their possible causes. If other problems arise, contact your
    system administrator, who can ask the AFS Product Support group for assistance if necessary.</para>
    <note>
        <para>To avoid degrading AFS performance, the Cache Manager on the translator machine does not immediately
        send changes made on NFS client machines to the File Server. Instead, it checks every 60 seconds for such
        changes and sends them then. It can take longer for changes made on an NFS client machine to be saved than for
        changes made on an AFS client machine. The save operation must complete before the changes are visible on NFS
        client machines that are using a different translator machine or on AFS client machines.</para>
    </note>
    <sect2 id="HDRWQ85"><title>Your NFS Client Machine is Frozen</title>
    <para>If your system administrator has used the recommended options when creating an NFS mount to an NFS/AFS
    translator machine, then the mount is both <emphasis>hard</emphasis> and <emphasis>interruptible</emphasis>:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>A hard mount means that the NFS client retries its requests if it does not receive a response
      within the expected time frame. This is useful because requests have to pass through both the NFS and AFS client
      software, which can sometimes take longer than the NFS client expects. However, it means that if the NFS/AFS
      translator machine actually becomes inaccessible, your NFS client machine can become inoperative
      (<emphasis>freeze</emphasis> or <emphasis>hang</emphasis>).</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>If the NFS mount is interruptible, then in the case of an NFS/AFS translator machine outage you
      can press &lt;<emphasis role="bold">Ctrl-c</emphasis>&gt; or another interrupt signal to halt the NFS client's
      repeated attempts to access AFS. You can then continue to work locally, or can NFS-mount another translator
      machine. If the NFS mount is not interruptible, you must actually remove the mount to the inaccessible translator
      machine.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </sect2><sect2 id="Header_165"><title>NFS/AFS Translator Reboots</title>
    <para>If you have authenticated to AFS and your translator machine reboots, you must issue the
    <emphasis role="bold">klog</emphasis> command (and <emphasis role="bold">knfs</emphasis> command, if appropriate)
    to reauthenticate. If you used the <emphasis role="bold">knfs</emphasis> command's
    <emphasis role="bold">-sysname</emphasis> argument to define your NFS client machine's system name, use it
    again.</para>
    </sect2><sect2 id="Header_166"><title>System Error Messages</title>
    <para>This section explains possible meanings for NFS error messages you receive while accessing AFS
    filespace.</para>
    <para><computeroutput>stale NFS client</computeroutput></para>
    <para><computeroutput>Getpwd: can't read</computeroutput></para>
    <para>Both messages possibly means that your translator machine was rebooted and cannot determine the pathname to
    the current working directory. To reestablish the path, change directory and specify the complete pathname starting
    with <emphasis role="bold">/afs</emphasis>.</para>
    <para><computeroutput>NFS server <replaceable>translator_machine</replaceable> is not responding still
    trying</computeroutput>.</para>
    <para>The NFS client is not getting a response from the NFS/AFS translator machine. If the NFS mount to the
    translator machine is a hard mount, your NFS client continues retrying the request until it gets a response (see
    <link linkend="HDRWQ85">Your NFS Client Machine is Frozen</link>). If the NFS mount to the translator machine is a
    soft mount, the NFS client stops retrying after a certain number of attempts (three by default).</para>
