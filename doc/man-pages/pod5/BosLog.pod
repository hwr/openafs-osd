BosLog - Traces BOS Server operations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<BosLog> file records a trace of Basic OverSeer (BOS) Server
(B<bosserver> process) operations on the local machine and describes any
error conditions it encounters.

If the F<BosLog> file does not already exist in the F</usr/afs/logs>
directory when the BOS Server starts, the server process creates it and
writes initial start-up messages to it.

The file is in ASCII format. Administrators listed in the
F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file can use the B<bos getlog> command to display
its contents. Alternatively, log onto the server machine and use a text
editor or a file display command such as the UNIX B<cat> command. By
default, the mode bits on the F<BosLog> file grant the required C<r>
(read) permission to all users.

The BOS Server records operations only as it completes them, and cannot
recover from failures by reviewing the file. The log contents are useful
for administrative evaluation of process failures and other problems.
