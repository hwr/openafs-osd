afs - Introduction to AFS files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A number of files must reside on the local disk of AFS server and client
machines. They belong to the following general categories:

=over 4

=item *

I<Configuration files> define configuration parameters for specific server
and kernel processes such as the Backup System Tape Coordinator or the
Cache Manager.

=item *

I<Administrative files> list information used in administration of server
machines, such as a list of privileged users or server encryption keys.

=item *

I<Cache-related files> contain cached data or information about cached
data, on client machines.

=item *

I<Log files> contain tracing messages about the operation of a specific
process.

=item *

I<Database files> contain database records used to administer the AFS
cell.

=item *

I<Controller files> control the behavior of a process.

=item *

I<Volume header files> represent AFS volumes on server partitions.

For a description of the format and contents of each file, see its
reference page.

Note for Windows users: Some files described in this document possibly do
not exist on machines that run a Windows operating system. Also, Windows
uses a backslash (C<\>) rather than a forward slash (C</>) to separate the
elements in a pathname.
