=head1 NAME

FileLog - Traces File Server operations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<FileLog> file records a trace of File Server (B<fileserver> process)
operations on the local machine and describes any error conditions it
encounters.

If the F<FileLog> file does not already exist in the
F</usr/afs/logs> directory when the File Server starts, the server
process creates it and writes initial start-up messages to it.

The file is in ASCII format. Administrators listed in the
F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file can use the B<bos getlog> command to display
its contents. Alternatively, log onto the file server machine and use a
text editor or a file display command such as the UNIX B<cat> command. By
default, the mode bits on the F<FileLog> file grant the required C<r>
(read) permission to all users.

The File Server records operations only as it completes them, and cannot
recover from failures by reviewing the file. The log contents are useful
for administrative evaluation of process failures and other problems.
