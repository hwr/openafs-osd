=head1 NAME

CellAlias - Maps cell names to aliases in /afs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<CellAlias> file is used by the Unix cache manager when it is using
Dynamic Root (B<-dynroot>) mode. It creates symbolic links in the dynamic
root (/afs) that link an alias for a cell (usually a short name) to the
full name for the cell.

The most common use of this configuration file is to allow short names for
frequently used cell names. Traditionally, such short names would be
created by the local AFS administrator by creating symbolic links in the
C<root.afs> volume. Such symlinks do not appear when Dynamic Root is
enabled because, with Dynamic Root, the Cache Manager does not mount or
look at the C<root.afs> volume. F<CellAlias> is a replacement that allows
such short names to be created under the client control.

If you configure a short name mapping such as C<ir> for
C<ir.example.org>, the mapping of C<.ir> to C<.ir.example.org> for the
read/write version of the C<root.cell> volume for that cell will be
created automatically. There is no need to list that alias
separately. B<afsd> will report an error on startup if the dotted entry is
listed separately.

The contents of the F<CellAlias> file should consist of one line of two
whitespace-separated columns per alias. The first column is the real name
of the cell, and the second column is the alias that should be created.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following F<CellAlias> file:

   prod.example.com prod
   test.example.org testcell

results in the following symbolic links:

   /afs/.prod      ->  /afs/.prod.example.com
   /afs/prod       ->  /afs/prod.example.com
   /afs/.testcell  ->  /afs/.testcell.example.org
   /afs/testcell   ->  /afs/testcell.example.org
