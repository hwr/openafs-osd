=head1 NAME

afsmonitor - Provides instructions for the afsmonitor command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The afsmonitor configuration file determines which machines the
B<afsmonitor> command probes for File Server or Cache Manager statistics
and which statistics it gathers. Use the B<-config> argument to the
B<afsmonitor> command to identify the configuration file to use.

The instructions that can appear in the configuration file are as follows:

=over 4

=item cm <I<host name>>

Names a client machine for which to display Cache Manager statistics. The
order of C<cm> lines in the file determines the order in which client
machines appear from top to bottom on the C<System Overview> and C<Cache
Managers> output screens.

=item fs <I<host name>>

Names a file server machine for which to display File Server
statistics. The order of C<fs> lines in the file determines the order in
which file server machines appear from top to bottom on the C<System
Overview> and C<File Servers> output screens.

=item thresh (fs | cm) <I<field>> <I<thresh>> [<I<cmd>>] [<I<arg>> ...]

Assigns the threshold value I<thresh> to the statistic I<field>, for
either a File Server statistic (C<fs>) or a Cache Manager statistic
(C<cm>). The optional I<cmd> field names a binary or script to execute
each time the value of the statistic changes from being below I<thresh> to
being at or above I<thresh>. A change between two values that both exceed
I<thresh> does not retrigger the binary or script. The optional I<arg>
fields are additional values that the B<afsmonitor> program passes as
arguments to the I<cmd> command. If any of them include one or more
spaces, enclose the entire field in double quotes.

The B<afsmonitor> program passes the following parameters to the I<cmd>:

    <hostname> (fs|cm) <field> <thresh> <actual> [<arg> ...]

The parameters C<fs>, C<cm>, <field>, <thresh>, and <arg> correspond to
the values with the same name on the thresh line. The <hostname> parameter
identifies the file server or client machine where the statistic has
crossed the threshold, and the <actual> parameter is the actual value of
<field> that exceeds the threshold value.

Use the C<thresh> line to set either a global threshold, which applies to
all file server machines listed on C<fs> lines or client machines listed
on C<cm> lines in the configuration file, or a machine-specific threshold,
which applies to only one file server or client machine.

=over 4

=item *

To set a global threshold, place the thresh line before any of the C<fs>
or C<cm> lines in the file.

=item *

To set a machine-specific threshold, place the thresh line below the
corresponding C<fs> or C<cm> line, and above any other C<fs> or C<cm>
lines. A machine-specific threshold value always overrides the
corresponding global threshold, if set. Do not place a C<thresh fs> line
directly after a C<cm> line or a C<thresh cm> line directly after a C<fs>
line.

=back

=item show (fs | cm) I<field/group/section>

Specifies which individual statistic, group of statistics, or section of
statistics to display on the C<File Servers> screen (C<fs>) or C<Cache
Managers> screen (C<cm>) and the order in which to display them. The
appendix of B<afsmonitor> statistics in the I<OpenAFS Administration
Guide> specifies the group and section to which each statistic
belongs. Include as many C<show> lines as necessary to customize the
screen display as desired, and place them anywhere in the file. The
top-to-bottom order of the C<show> lines in the configuration file
determines the left-to-right order in which the statistics appear on the
corresponding screen.

If there are no C<show> lines in the configuration file, then the screens
display all statistics for both Cache Managers and File
Servers. Similarly, if there are no C<show fs> lines, the C<File Servers>
screen displays all file server statistics, and if there are no C<show cm>
lines, the C<Cache Managers> screen displays all client statistics.

=item # I<comments>

Precedes a line of text that the afsmonitor program ignores because of the
initial number (C<#>) sign, which must appear in the very first column of
the line.

=item B<version>

Print the OpenAFS command suite version and then exit.

field of a C<show> instruction, see the B<afsmonitor> statistics appendix
