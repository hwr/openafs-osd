=head1 NAME

fs_listquota - Displays quota information for a volume

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<fs listquota> S<<< [B<-path> <I<dir/file path>>+] >>> [B<-human>] [B<-help>]

B<fs listq> S<<< [B<-p> <I<dir/file path>>+] >>> [B<-hu>] [B<-he>]

B<fs lq> S<<< [B<-p> <I<dir/file path>>+] >>> [B<-hu>] [B<-he>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fs listquota> command displays information about the volume
containing each specified directory or file (its name, quota, and amount
of disk space used), along with an indicator of the percentage of space
used on the host partition.

To display more information about the host partition, use the B<fs
examine> command.

To set volume quota, use the B<fs setquota> or B<fs setvol> command.

=head1 CAUTIONS

=include fragments/volsize-caution.pod

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-path> <I<dir/file path>>+

Names a file or directory that resides in the volume about which to
produce output. Partial pathnames are interpreted relative to the current
working directory, which is also the default value if this argument is
omitted.

=item B<-human>

Print space in a "human-readable" format. Instead of always printing space
in kilobytes, show disk space in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
terabytes, or petabytes, as appropriate.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The output displays information about the volume that houses each
specified directory or file, in a tabular format that uses the following
headers:

=over 4

=item Volume Name

The name of the volume.

=item Quota

The volume's quota in kilobytes, or the string C<no limit> to indicate an
unlimited quota.

=item Used

The amount of space used. If B<-human> is not specified, this value is in
kilobytes.

=item % Used

The percentage of the volume's quota that is used (the C<Used> statistic
divided by the C<Quota> statistic, times 100).

=item Partition

The percentage of space used on the partition that houses the
volume. Although not directly related to how much of the user's quota is
used, it is reported because a full partition can cause writing of data
back to the volume to fail even when the volume has not reached its quota.

Note that due to limitations in the current wire protocol, OpenAFS cannot
accurately calculate this field for partitions over 2 terabytes (2^41 bytes)
in size. As a result, the percentage displayed in this field may be smaller
than reality. For example, if the partition has over 2 terabytes (2^41 bytes)
free, B<fs listquota> will report the partition usage as 0%. If the partition
has less than 2 terabytes (2^41 bytes) free, but is larger than 2 terabytes
(2^41 bytes) in size, the reported partition usage will be larger than
0%, but will still be less than the actual usage.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows the output for the volume C<user.smith>:

   % fs listquota -path /afs/example.com/usr/smith
   Volume Name     Quota    Used    % Used   Partition
   user.smith      15000    5071       34%         86%

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the C<r> (read) permission on the ACL of the root
directory of the volume that houses the file or directory named by the
B<-path> argument, and C<l> (list) permission on the ACL of each
directory that precedes it in the pathname.
