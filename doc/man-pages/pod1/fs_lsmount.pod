=head1 NAME

fs_lsmount - Reports the volume for which a directory is the mount point.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<fs lsmount> S<<< B<-dir> <I<directory>>+ >>> [B<-help>]

S<<< B<fs ls -d> <I<directory>>+ >>> [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fs lsmount> command reports the volume for which each specified
directory is a mount point, or indicates with an error message that a
directory is not a mount point or is not in AFS.

To create a mount point, use the B<fs mkmount> command. To remove one, use
the B<fs rmmount> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-dir> <I<directory>>+

Names the directory that serves as a mount point for a volume. The last
element in the pathname provided must be an actual name, not a shorthand
notation such as one or two periods (C<.> or C<..>).

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If the specified directory is a mount point, the output is of the
following form:

   '<directory>' is a mount point for volume '<volume name>'

where

=over 4

=item *

A number sign (C<#>) precedes the <volume name> string for a regular mount
point.

=item *

A percent sign (C<%>) precedes the <volume name> string for a read/write
mount point.

=item *

A cell name and colon (C<:>) follow the number or percent sign and precede
the <volume name> string for a cellular mount point.

=back

The B<fs mkmount> reference page explains how the Cache Manager interprets
each of the three types of mount points.

If the directory is a symbolic link to a mount point, the output is of the
form:

   '<directory>' is a symbolic link, leading to a mount point for volume
   '<volume name>'

If the directory is not a mount point or is not in AFS, the output reads:

   '<directory>' is not a mount point.

If the output is garbled, it is possible that the mount point has become
corrupted in the local AFS client cache. Use the B<fs flushmount> command
to discard it, which forces the Cache Manager to refetch the mount point.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows the mount point for the home directory of user
C<smith>:

   % fs lsmount /afs/example.com/usr/smith
   '/afs/example.com/usr/smith' is a mount point for volume '#user.smith'

The following example shows both the regular and read/write mount points
for the Example Corporation cell's C<root.cell> volume.

   % fs lsmount /afs/example.com
   '/afs/example.com' is a mount point for volume '#root.cell'

   % fs lsmount /afs/.example.com
   '/afs/.example.com' is a mount point for volume '%root.cell'

The following example shows a cellular mount point: the Example Organization
cell's C<root.cell> volume as mounted in the Example Corporation cell's tree.

   % fs lsmount /afs/example.org
   '/afs/example.org' is a mount point for volume '#example.org:root.cell'

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the C<l> (lookup) permission on the ACL of the root
directory of the volume that houses the file or directory named by the
B<-dir> argument, and on the ACL of each directory that precedes it in the
pathname.
