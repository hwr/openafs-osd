=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts setmax> command sets the value of one or both counters that
track the IDs the Protection Server allocates to new users, machines, or
groups: the C<max user id> counter for the AFS user IDs (AFS UIDs)
assigned to users and machines, and the C<max group id> counter for the
AFS group IDs (AFS GIDs) assigned to groups.

Use the B<pts listmax> command to display the current value of both
counters.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-group> <I<group max>>

Sets the C<max group id> counter. Precede the value with a hyphen to
indicate that it is negative. When an administrator next uses the B<pts
creategroup> command to create a group entry and does not include that
command's B<-id> argument, the Protection Server assigns the group an AFS
GID one less (more negative) than this value.

=item B<-user> <I<user max>>

Sets the C<max user id> counter. When an administrator next uses the B<pts
createuser> command to create a user or machine entry and does not include
that command's B<-id> argument, the Protection Server assigns the group an
AFS UID one greater than this value.
