=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts sleep> pauses for a specified number of seconds. The command can
be run from the command line or interactively, although from the command
line it's essentially equivalent to the B<sleep> command. It is intended
for use in interactive mode to pause for a few seconds between batch
commands to allow the Protection Server to catch up.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Prior to OpenAFS 1.4.5 and OpenAFS 1.5.23, the B<pts sleep> command was
only available on Unix or Linux and when OpenAFS was compiled with the
supergroups option (disabled by default).  As of OpenAFS 1.4.5 and 1.5.23,
it is always available.

=head1 OPTIONS

Although they have no effect, B<pts sleep> takes the following standard
B<pts> options:

=over 4

=item B<-delay> <I<# of seconds>>

Specifies the amount of time to sleep, in seconds.

=include fragments/pts-common.pod

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

   pts> quit
