fs_setquota - Sets the quota for the volume containing a file or directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fs setquota> S<<< [B<-path> <I<dir/file path>>] >>>
    S<<< B<-max> <I<max quota in kbytes>> >>> [B<-help>]

B<fs setq> S<<< [B<-p> <I<dir/file path>>] >>> S<<< B<-m> <I<max quota>> >>> [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fs setquota> command sets the quota (maximum possible size) of the
read/write volume that contains the directory or file named by the
B<-path> argument.

To set the quota on multiple volumes at the same time, use the B<fs
setvol> command.

To display a volume's quota, use the B<fs examine>, B<fs listquota>, or
B<fs quota> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-path> <I<dir/file path>>

Names the directory or file for which to set the host volume's
quota. Partial pathnames are interpreted relative to the current working
directory, which is also the default value if this argument is omitted.

Specify the read/write path to the file or directory, to avoid the failure
that results from attempting to change a read-only volume. By convention,
the read/write path is indicated by placing a period before the cell name
at the pathname's second level (for example, F</afs/.example.com>). For
further discussion of the concept of read/write and read-only paths
through the filespace, see the B<fs mkmount> reference page.

=item B<-max> <I<max quota>>

Sets the maximum amount of file server disk space the volume can occupy.
The quota value should be a positive integer followed by an optional
suffix: C<K> for kibibytes (1024 bytes, the default), C<M> for mebibytes
(1024 kibibytes), C<G> for gibibytes (1024 mebibytes), and C<T> for
tebibytes (1024 gibibytes).  A value of C<0> sets an unlimited quota, but
the size of the disk partition that houses the volume places an absolute
limit on the volume's size.

If the B<-path> argument is omitted (to set the quota of the volume
housing the current working directory), the B<-max> switch must be
included with this argument.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command imposes a maximum quota of 3000 kilobytes on the
volume that houses the F</afs/example.com/usr/smith> directory:

   % fs setquota -path /afs/example.com/usr/smith -max 3000
