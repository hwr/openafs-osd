=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts listowned> command lists the groups owned by each user or group
specified by the B<-nameorid> argument.

To list any I<orphaned group>s, whose owners have themselves been deleted
from the Protection Database, provide a value of C<0> (zero) for the
B<-nameorid> argument. To change the owner to a user or group that still
exists, use the B<pts chown> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-nameorid> <I<user or group name or id>>+

Specifies the name or AFS UID of each user, or the name or AFS GID of each
group, for which to display the list of owned groups. It is acceptable to
mix users and groups on the same command line, as well as names and
IDs. Precede the GID of each group with a hyphen to indicate that it is
negative.

A value of 0 (zero) lists group entries for groups whose owners no longer
have entries in the Protection Database.

=include fragments/pts-common.pod

=head1 OUTPUT

The first line of the output indicates the name and AFS UID or AFS GID of
each user or group for which ownership information is requested, in the
following format:

   Groups owned by <name> (id: <ID>) are:

A list of groups follows. The list does not include groups owned by groups
that the user or group owns, or to which the user or group belongs. If the
user or group does not own any groups, only the header line appears.

The following error message appears if the issuer is not privileged to
view ownership information. By default, for both user and group entries
the second privacy flag is the hyphen, which denies permission to anyone
other than the user (for a user entry) and the members of the
system:administrators group.

   pts: Permission denied so failed to get owner list for <name> (id: <ID>)

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example lists the groups owned by user terry and shows that
the group C<terry:friends> does not own any groups:

   % pts listowned terry terry:friends
   Groups owned by terry (id: 1045) are:
     terry:friends
     terry:project1
     terry:project2
   Groups owned by terry:friends (id: -673) are:

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The required privilege depends on the setting of the second privacy flag
in the Protection Database entry of each user or group indicated by the
B<-nameorid> argument (use the B<pts examine> command to display the
flags):

=over 4

=item *

If it is the hyphen and the B<-nameorid> argument specifies a group, only
the members of the system:administrators group and the owner of a group
can list the groups it owns.

=item *

If it is the hyphen and the B<-nameorid> argument specifies a user, only
the members of the system:administrators group and the associated user can
list the groups he or she owns.

=item *

If it is uppercase letter C<O>, anyone who can access the cell's database
server machines can list the groups owned by this user or group.
