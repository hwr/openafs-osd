=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts rename> command changes the name of the user, machine, or group
entry specified by the B<-oldname> argument to the name specified by the
B<-newname> argument. It is not possible to change a user or machine
entry's name to look like a regular group entry's name (have a colon in
it).

Members of the system:administrators group can change a regular group name
into a prefix-less name and vice versa. When changing a prefix-less group
name into a regular group name or a regular group name to another regular
group name, the owner field of the new name (the part before the colon)
must correctly reflect the group's owner.

Changing a regular group's owner with the B<pts chown> command
automatically changes the owner field (the part before the colon) of the
group's name, but does not change the owner field of any groups owned by
the group. Use this command to rename those groups to a form that
accurately reflects their ownership.

=head1 CAUTIONS

By convention, many aspects of an AFS user account have the same name as
the user's Protection Database entry, including the Authentication
Database entry, volume, and mount point. When using this command to change
a user name, also change the names of all related entities to maintain
consistency. For instructions, see the chapter on user accounts in the
I<OpenAFS Administration Guide>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-oldname> <I<old name>>

Specifies the current full name of the entry.

=item B<-newname> <I<new name>>

Specifies the new full name for the entry. For regular groups, the owner
field (the part before the colon) of the new name must reflect the actual
ownership of the group.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example changes the name of the group staff, owned by the
privileged user C<admin>, to C<admin:staff>:

   % pts rename -oldname staff -newname admin:staff

The following example changes the name of the group C<admin:finance> to
the group C<finance>. The issuer must belong to the system:administrators
group.

   % pts rename -oldname admin:finance -newname finance

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

To change a regular group name to a prefix-less name or vice versa, or to
change a user or machine entry's name, the issuer must belong to the
system:administrators group.

To change a group name to a new name of the same type (regular or
prefix-less), the issuer must own the group or belong to the
system:administrators group.
