=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts listmax> command displays the values of the C<max user id> and
C<max group id> counters, which the Protection Server uses to track the
AFS user IDs (AFS UIDs) it allocates to new users or machines, and the AFS
group IDs (AFS GIDs) it allocates to new groups, respectively. When an
administrator next issues the B<pts createuser> command and does not
include the B<-id> argument, the new user or machine receives an AFS UID
one greater than the C<max user id> counter, and when a user issues the
B<pts creategroup> command and does not include the B<-id> argument, the
new group receives an AFS UID one less (more negative) than the C<max
group id> counter.

To reset one or both counters, members of the system:administrators group
can issue the B<pts setmax> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-auth>

Use the calling user's tokens to communicate with the Protection Server. For
more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-config> <I<config directory>>

Use an alternate config directory. For more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-encrypt>

Encrypts any communication with the Protection Server. For more details, see
L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-force>

Enables the command to continue executing as far as possible when errors
or other problems occur, rather than halting execution at the first error.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> 
or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the issuer. For more
details, see L<pts(1)>.
