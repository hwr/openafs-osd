=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<dlog> command obtains DCE credentials for the issuer from the DCE
Security Service in the cell named by the B<-cell> argument, and stores
them on the AFS client machine on which the user issues the command. The
AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit Protocol Translator processes running on
machines in the DCE cell accept the credentials, which enables the user to
access the DCE cell's filespace from the AFS client. The user's identity
in the local file system is unchanged.

If the issuer does not provide the B<-principal> argument, the B<dlog>
command interpreter uses the user name under which the issuer is logged
into the local file system. Provide the DCE password for the appropriate
user name. As with the B<klog> command, the password does not cross the
network in clear text (unless the issuer is logged into the AFS client
from a remote machine).

The credentials are valid for a lifetime equivalent to the smallest of the
following, all but the last of which is defined by the DCE cell's Security
Server:

=over 4

=item *

The maximum certificate lifetime for the issuer's DCE account.

=item *

The maximum certificate lifetime for the AFS principal's DCE account.

=item *

The registry-wide maximum certificate lifetime.

=item *

The registry-wide default certificate lifetime.

=item *

The lifetime requested using the B<-lifetime> argument.

=back

If the previous maximum certificate lifetime values are set to
C<default-policy>, the maximum possible ticket lifetime is defined by the
default certificate lifetime. Refer to the DCE vendor's administration
guide for more information before setting any of these values.

The AFS Cache Manager stores the ticket in a credential structure
associated with the name of the issuer (or the user named by the
B<-principal> argument. If the user already has a ticket for the DCE cell,
the ticket resulting from this command replaces it in the credential
structure.

The AFS tokens command displays the ticket obtained by the B<dlog> command
for the server principal C<afs>, regardless of the principal to which it
is actually granted. Note that the B<tokens> command does not distinguish
tickets for a DFSTM File Server from tickets for an AFS File Server.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-principal> <I<user name>>

Specifies the DCE user name for which to obtain DCE credentials. If this
option is omitted, the B<dlog> command interpreter uses the name under
which the issuer is logged into the local file system.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Specifies the DCE cell in which to authenticate. During a single login
session on a given machine, a user can authenticate in multiple cells
simultaneously, but can have only one ticket at a time for each cell (that
is, it is possible to authenticate under only one identity per cell per
machine). It is legal to abbreviate the cell name to the shortest form
that distinguishes it from the other cells listed in the
F</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file on the local client machine.

If the issuer does not provide the B<-cell> argument, the B<dlog> command
attempts to authenticate with the DCE Security Server for the cell defined
by

=over 4

=item *

The value of the environment variable AFSCELL on the local AFS client
machine, if defined. The issuer can set the AFSCELL environment variable
to name the desired DCE cell.

=item *

The cell name in the F</usr/vice/etc/ThisCell> file on the local AFS
client machine. The machine's administrator can place the desired DCE
cell's name in the file.

=back

=item B<-password> <I<user's password>>

Specifies the password for the issuer (or for the user named by the
B<-principal> argument). Using this argument is not recommended, because
it makes the password visible on the command line.  If this argument is
omitted, the command prompts for the password and does not echo it
visibly.

=item B<-servers> <I<list of servers>>+

Specifies a list of DFS database server machines running the Translator
Server through which the AFS client machine can attempt to
authenticate. Specify each server by hostname, shortened machine name, or
IP address. If this argument is omitted, the B<dlog> command interpreter
randomly selects a machine from the list of DFS Fileset Location (FL)
Servers in the F</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file for the DCE cell specified
by the B<-cell> argument. This argument is useful for testing when
authentication seems to be failing on certain server machines.

=item B<-lifetime> <I<ticket lifetime>>

Requests a ticket lifetime using the format I<hh>B<:>I<mm>[B<:>I<ss>]
(hours, minutes, and optionally a number seconds between 00 and 59).  For
example, the value C<168:30> requests a ticket lifetime of 7 days and 30
minutes, and C<96:00> requests a lifetime of 4 days. Acceptable values
range from C<00:05> (5 minutes) to C<720:00> (30 days). If this argument
is not provided and no other determinants of ticket lifetime have been
changed from their defaults, ticket lifetime is 10 hours.

The requested lifetime must be smaller than any of the DCE cell's
determinants for ticket lifetime; see the discussion in the preceding
B<Description> section.

=item B<-setpag>

Creates a process authentication group (PAG) in which the newly created
ticket is placed. If this flag is omitted, the ticket is instead
associated with the issuers' local user ID (UID).

=item B<-pipe>

Suppresses any prompts that the command interpreter otherwise produces,
including the prompt for the issuer's password. Instead, the command
interpreter accepts the password via the standard input stream.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If the dlog command interpreter cannot contact a Translator
Server, it produces a message similar to the following:

   dlog: server or network not responding -- failed to contact
   authentication service

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command authenticates the issuer as cell_admin in the
C<dce.example.com> cell.

   % dlog -principal cell_admin -cell dce.example.com
   Password: <cell_admin's password>

In the following example, the issuer authenticates as cell_admin to the
C<dce.example.com> cell and request a ticket lifetime of 100 hours. The
B<tokens> command confirms that the user obtained DCE credentials as the
user C<cell_admin>: the AFS ID is equivalent to the UNIX ID of C<1>
assigned to C<cell_admin> in C<dce.example.com> cell's DCE registry.

   % dlog -principal cell_admin -cell dce.example.com -lifetime 100
   Password: <cell_admin's password>

   % tokens
   Tokens held by the Cache Manager:

   User's (AFS ID 1) tokens for afs@dce.example.com [Expires Jul 6 14:12]
   User's (AFS ID 4758) tokens for afs@example.com [Expires Jul 2 13:14]

      --End of list--
