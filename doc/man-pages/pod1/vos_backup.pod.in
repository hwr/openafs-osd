=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos backup> command clones the indicated read/write volume to create
a backup version, placing it at the same site as the read/write
version. The backup volume's name is the same as the read/write source's
with the addition of the C<.backup> extension. Its volume ID number is the
one allocated for it in the Volume Location Database (VLDB) when the
read/write source was created with the B<vos create> command. If a backup
version already exists, the new clone replaces it.

To create a backup version of multiple volumes, use the B<vos backupsys>
command.
