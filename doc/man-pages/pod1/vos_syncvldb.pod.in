=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos syncvldb> command verifies that the status of the volumes housed
either on all partitions on the file server machine specified by the
B<-server> argument, or on the single partition specified by the
B<-server> and B<-partition> arguments, is recorded correctly in the
VLDB. If the B<-volume> argument is included to indicate a single volume,
the command compares only its status on the file server machine with its
VLDB entry.

If the B<-volume> argument is not included, the command interpreter
obtains from the Volume Server a list of the volumes that reside on each
partition, then changes information in the VLDB as necessary to reflect
their state on the partition. For example, it creates or updates a VLDB
entry when it finds a volume for which the VLDB entry is missing or
incomplete. However, if there is already a VLDB entry that defines a
different location for the volume, or there are irreconcilable conflicts
with other VLDB entries, it instead writes a message about the conflict to
the standard error stream. The command never removes volumes from the file
server machine.

To achieve complete VLDB consistency, run this command on all file server
machines in the cell, and then run the B<vos syncserv> command on all file
server machines in the cell.

Using the B<-volume> argument basically combines the effects of this
command with those of the B<vos syncserv> command, for a single
volume. The command not only verifies that the VLDB entry is correct for
the specified volume type (read/write, backup, or read-only), but also
checks that any related volume types mentioned in the VLDB entry actually
exist at the site listed in the entry. It is not necessary to provide the
B<-server> argument (and optionally, B<-partition> argument); if one or
both is provided, the results are reliable only if they specify the actual
location of the volume indicated by the B<-volume> argument.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<server name>>

Identifies the file server machine housing the volumes for which to verify
VLDB entries. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either
fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Identifies the partition housing the volumes for which to verify VLDB
entries. Provide the B<-server> argument along with this one. Provide the
partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example, C</vicepa>)
or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated forms. For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-volume> <I<volume name or ID>>

Specifies the name or volume ID number of a single volume for which to
verify the VLDB entry. This argument can be combined with the B<-server>
(and optionally, the B<-partition>) argument.

=item B<-dryrun>

Show the actions which would be taken, but do not make changes.

=include fragments/vos-common.pod

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example command verifies the VLDB entry for each volume
stored on the file server machine C<fs4.example.com>.

   % vos syncvldb fs4.example.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
