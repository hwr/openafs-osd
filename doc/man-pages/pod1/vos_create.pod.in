=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos create> command creates a read/write volume with the name
specified by the B<-name> argument at the site specified by the B<-server>
and B<-partition> arguments. In addition, the command allocates or sets
the following:

=over 4

=item *

Volume ID numbers for the read/write volume and its associated read-only
and backup volumes (this command does not actually create the latter two
types of volume). A volume ID number is an identification number
guaranteed to be unique within a cell.

=item *

An access control list (ACL) associated with the volume's root directory,
which takes the same name as volume's mount point when the volume is
mounted with the B<fs mkmount> command. An entry that grants all seven
permissions to the members of the system:administrators group is
automatically placed on the ACL. (In addition, the File Server by default
always implicitly grants the C<l> (lookup) and C<a> (administer)
permissions on every ACL to members of the system:administrators group,
even when the group does not appear on an ACL; use the B<-implicit>
argument to the B<fileserver> initialization command to alter the set of
rights on a server-by-server basis if desired.)

=item *

The volume's space quota, set to 5000 kilobyte blocks by default. Use the
B<-maxquota> argument to specify a different quota, or use the B<fs
setquota> command to change the volume's quota after mounting the volume
with the B<fs mkmount> command.

=back

The volume is empty when created. To access it via the Cache Manager,
mount it in the file space by using the B<fs mkmount> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<server name>>

Identifies the file server machine on which to create the read/write
volume. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully
qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Identifies the partition on which to create the read/write volume, on the
file server machine specified by the B<-server> argument.  Provide the
partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example, C</vicepa>)
or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated forms. For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-name> <I<volume name>>

Specifies a name for the read/write volume. The maximum length is 22
characters, which can include any alphanumeric or punctuation
character. By convention, periods separate the fields in a name.  Do not
apply the C<.backup> or C<.readonly> extension to a read/write volume
name; they are reserved for the Volume Server to add to the read/write
name when creating those backup and read-only volumes respectively.

=item B<-maxquota> <I<initial quota>>

Specifies the maximum amount of disk space the volume can use.  The size
should be a positive integer followed by an optional suffix: C<K> for
kibibytes (1024 bytes, the default), C<M> for mebibytes (1024 kibibytes),
C<G> for gibibytes (1024 mebibytes), and C<T> for tebibytes (1024
gibibytes).  The value C<0> (zero) grants an unlimited quota, but the size
of the disk partition that houses the volume places an absolute limit on
its size.  If this argument is omitted, the default value is C<5000K>.

=item B<-id> <I<volume ID>>

Specifies the volume ID for the read/write volume. If this options is not
specified, or the given volume ID is 0, a volume ID will be allocated for
the volume automatically. The volume IDs allocated should be fine for
almost all cases, so you should almost never need to specify this option.

=item B<-roid> <I<readonly volume ID>>

Specifies the volume ID for the readonly volume corresponding to the
read/write volume that is being created. The readonly volume will not be
created; this merely specifies what volume ID the readonly volume will use
when it is created. If a volume ID of 0 is specified here, no readonly
volume ID will be assigned to the created volume immediately. A readonly
volume ID can still be assigned later when B<vos addsite> is run; if a
volume does not have a readonly volume ID associated with it by the time
B<vos release> is run, a volume ID will be allocated for it.

If this option is not specified, the default readonly volume ID is one
number higher than the read-write volume ID, whether or not that ID was
manually specified.

As with the B<-id> option, the default allocated volume IDs should be
sufficient for almost all cases, so you should almost never need to
specify them explicitly. This option is available in OpenAFS
versions 1.5.61 or later.

=head1 OUTPUT

The Volume Server produces the following message to confirm that it
created the volume:

   Volume <volume_ID> created on partition <partition_name> of <machine_name>

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command creates the read/write volume C<user.pat> on the
F</vicepf> partition of the file server machine C<fs4.example.com>.

   % vos create -server fs4.example.com -partition /vicepf -name user.pat
   Volume user.pat created on partition /vicepf of fs4.example.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
