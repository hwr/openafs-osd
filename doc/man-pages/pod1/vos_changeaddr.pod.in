=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos changeaddr> command removes a server entry from the Volume
Location Database (VLDB) when the B<-remove> flag is combined with the
B<-oldaddr> argument. There must be no VLDB entries that list the machine
as a site for any version of a volume (if necessary, use the B<vos move>
or B<vos remove> command to move or remove volumes). It is appropriate to
remove a VLDB server entry when removing the corresponding file server
machine from service.

To display all VLDB server entries, use the B<vos listaddrs> command.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Combining the command's B<-oldaddr> and B<-newaddr> arguments is no longer
the appropriate way to change the IP address registered for a file server
machine. Furthermore, if a machine is multihomed and its server entry
includes several addresses, then the address specified with the
B<-newaddr> argument replaces all of the addresses currently listed in the
server entry that includes the address specified by the B<-oldaddr>
argument. This effectively makes the machine single-homed with respect to
AFS operations, which is probably not the desired result.

The recommended method for changing the IP addresses in a server entry is
instead to restart the C<fs> process group (which includes the File
Server) after using the utilities provided by the operating system to
reconfigure the machine's network interfaces. For a description of how the
File Server constructs and registers a list of its network interfaces in
the VLDB, see L<sysid(5)>.

If, counter to recommended usage, the command is used to change the IP
address in a server entry, it does not also change the names of machine
entries in the Protection Database. Operations fail when they refer to a
protection group that has an obsolete IP address in it. Use the B<pts
rename> command to change the names of machine entries that correspond to
the addresses changed with this command. Changing the address of a
database server machine also requires updating the client and server
versions of the F<CellServDB> file on every machine.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-oldaddr> <I<original IP address>>

Specifies the IP address currently registered for the file server machine
in the VLDB server entry. If there are multiple addresses registered for a
multihomed machine, use any of them to identify the server entry.

=item B<-newaddr> <I<new IP address>>

Specifies the new IP address that replaces all currently registered
addresses.

Unless the B<-force> option is given, B<vos changeaddr> will refuse to change
addresses when the address given in B<-oldaddr> is registered with a multihomed
server entry in the VLDB. See L</CAUTIONS>.

=item B<-remove>

Removes from the VLDB the server entry that includes the address specified
by the B<-oldaddr> argument.

=item B<-force>

Overrides the multihomed server entry check when the B<-oldaddr> and
B<-newaddr> options are combined. The B<-force> flag is provided for historical
compatibility and is not recommended.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command removes the VLDB server entry that includes the IP
address C<192.12.107.214>.

   % vos changeaddr -oldaddr 192.12.107.214 -remove

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

Issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the machine
specified with the B<-oldaddr> argument and on each database server
machine.
