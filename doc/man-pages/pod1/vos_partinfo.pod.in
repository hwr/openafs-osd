=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vos partinfo command reports the amount of space available and total
size on either all of the partitions on the indicated file server machine
(if the B<-partition> argument is omitted) or the specified partition on
that file server machine. The Volume Location Database (VLDB) is not
consulted.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<server name>>

Identifies the file server machine for which to display partition
information. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either
fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Identifies which partition on the file server machine specified by the
B<-server> argument for which to display information. Provide the
partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example, C</vicepa>)
or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated forms. For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-summary>

Prints storage summary.

=include fragments/vos-common.pod

=head1 CAUTIONS

The partition-related statistics in this command's output do not always
agree with the corresponding values in the output of the standard UNIX
B<df> command. The statistics reported by this command can be up to five
minutes old, because the Cache Manager polls the File Server for partition
information at that frequency. Also, on some operating systems, the B<df>
command's report of partition size includes reserved space not included in
this command's calculation, and so is likely to be about 10% larger.

=head1 OUTPUT

The output reports the amount of space available and total space for each
specified partition.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command displays all partitions on the file server machine
C<fs2.example.com>.

   % vos partinfo fs2.example.com
   Free space on partition /vicepa: 27301 K blocks out of total 549197
   Free space on partition /vicepb: 13646 K blocks out of total 69194
   Free space on partition /vicepc: 31798 K blocks out of total 320315
   Free space on partition /vicepd: 33302 K blocks out of total 494954
