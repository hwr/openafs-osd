=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts membership> command lists the groups to which each user or
machine specified by the B<-nameorid> argument belongs, or lists the users
and machines that belong to each group specified by the B<-nameorid>
argument.

It is not possible to list the members of the system:anyuser or
system:authuser groups, and they do not appear in the list of groups to
which a user belongs.

To add users or machine to groups, use the B<pts adduser> command; to remove
them, use the B<pts removeuser> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-nameorid> <I<user or group name or id>>+

Specifies the name or AFS UID of each user entry, the IP address (complete
or wildcard-style) or AFS UID of each machine entry, or the name or AFS
GID of each group, for which to list group membership. It is acceptable to
mix users, machines, and groups on the same command line, as well as names
and IDs. Precede the GID of each group with a hyphen to indicate that it
is negative.

=item B<-supergroups>

List the groups to which each group specified by the B<-nameorid>
argument belongs, in addition to user and machine members. Group
membership may be nested when B<ptserver> is compiled with the
SUPERGROUPS option enabled.

=item B<-expandgroups>

Instead of listing only the groups in which the user or machine is a direct
member, list every group in which the user or machine belongs, including
membership due to nested groups, for each user or machine specified by
the B<-nameorid> argument.

Instead of listing groups which are members of a group, list every user and
machine which is a member of a group, including the users and machines which
are members due to nested groups, for each group specified by the B<-nameorid>
argument.

Group membership may be nested when B<ptserver> is compiled with the
SUPERGROUPS option enabled.

=head1 OUTPUT

For each user and machine, the output begins with the following header
line, followed by a list of the groups to which the user or machine
belongs:

   Groups <name> (id: <AFS UID>) is a member of:

For each group, the output begins with the following header line, followed
by a list of the users and machines who belong to the group:

   Members of <group_name> (id: <AFS GID>) are:

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example lists the groups to which the user C<pat> belongs
and the members of the group C<smith:friends>.  Note that third privacy
flag for the C<pat> entry was changed from the default hyphen to enable a
non-administrative user to obtain this listing.

   % pts membership pat smith:friends
   Groups pat (id: 1144) is a member of:
     smith:friends
     staff
     johnson:project-team
   Members of smith:friends (id: -562) are:
     pat
     terry
     jones
     richard
     thompson

The following example shows how to list the groups to which nested groups
belong. In this example the group C<executives> is a member of the group
C<management> and the group C<management> is a member of the group C<staff>.
The group C<management> is called a supergroup of the group C<executives> and the
group C<staff> is called a supergroup of the group C<management>.

   % pts membership executives
   Members of executives (id: -208) are:
     jane

   % pts membership executives -supergroups
   Members of executives (id: -208) are:
     jane
   Groups executives (id: -208) is a member of:
     management

   % pts membership management -supergroups
   Members of management (id: -207) are:
     executives
     mary
     sarah
     carol
   Groups management (id: -207) is a member of:
      staff

   % pts membership staff -supergroups
   Members of staff (id: -206) are:
     sales
     marketing
     engineering
     management
   Groups staff (id: -206) is a member of:

The following example shows how to find all the users which belong
to a group, including users of nested groups. In this example, the
user C<jane> is listed as an expanded member of the group C<management>
instead of the group C<executives>.

   % pts membership management -expandgroups
   Expanded Members of management (id: -207) are:
     jane
     mary
     sarah
     carol

The following example shows how to find all the groups a user
is a member of, including membership due to nested groups.  In
this example the user C<jane> is a direct member of the group
C<executives>. The C<-expandgroups> flag shows all the groups
to which C<jane> has membership status.

   % pts membership jane
   Groups jane (id: 7) is a member of:
     executives

   % pts membership jane -expandgroups
   Expanded Groups jane (id: 7) is a member of:
     staff
     management
     executives

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

Members of the system:ptsviewers and system:administrators groups can
always use this command in any of its variations.  Additionally, a user
can always list the groups to which they belong, and the owner of a group
can always list the members of the group.

Additional privileges may be granted by the setting of the third privacy
flag in the Protection Database entry of each user or group indicated by
the B<-nameorid> argument (use the B<pts examine> command to display the
flags):

=over 4

=item *

If it is a hyphen, the default permissions described above apply.

=item *

If it is lowercase C<m> and the B<-nameorid> argument specifies a group,
then members of that group can also list the other members.  A privacy
flag of C<m> only changes the permissions when set for a group.  Setting
this flag for a user or a machine has no effect.

=item *

If it is uppercase C<M>, anyone who can access the cell's database server
machines can list the membership of the group or the groups to which that
user or machine belongs, depending on what type of entry the flag is set
on.
