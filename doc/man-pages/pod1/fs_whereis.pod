=head1 OUTPUT

The output includes a line for each specified directory or file. It names
the file server machine on which the volume that houses the specified
directory or file resides. A list of multiple machines indicates that the
directory or file is in a replicated volume.

Machine names usually have a suffix indicating their cell membership. If
the cell is not clear, use the B<fs whichcell> command to display the cell
in which the directory or file resides. To display the cell membership of
the local machine, use the B<fs wscell> command.

F</afs/example.com> resides is replicated on both C<fs1.example.com> and
