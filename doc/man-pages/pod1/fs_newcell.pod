=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fs newcell> command removes the Cache Manager's kernel-resident list
of database server machines for the cell specified by the B<-name>
argument and replaces it with the database server machines named by the
B<-servers> argument.

Each time the machine reboots, the Cache Manager constructs the kernel
list of cells and database server machines by reading the local
F</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file. This command does not change the
F<CellServDB> file, so any changes made with it persist only until the
next reboot, unless the issuer also edits the file. The output of the B<fs
listcells> command reflects changes made with this command, because that
command consults the kernel-resident list rather than the F<CellServDB>
file.

This command can introduce a completely new cell into the kernel-resident
list, but cannot make a cell inaccessible (it is not possible to remove a
cell's entry from the kernel-resident list by providing no values for the
B<-server> argument). To make a cell inaccessible, remove its entry from
the F<CellServDB> file and reboot the machine.

If the B<-name> argument names a DCE cell, then the B<-servers> argument
names DFS Fileset Location (FL) Server machines. The B<-linkedcell>
argument specifies the name of the AFS cell to link to a DCE cell for the
purpose of DFS fileset location.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Some commands, such as the B<aklog> or B<klog.krb5> commands, work correctly
only when the information is accurate for a cell in both the F<CellServDB> file
and the kernel-resident list.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-name> <I<cell name>>

Specifies the fully-qualified cell name of the AFS or DCE cell.

=item B<-servers> <I<primary servers>>+

Specifies the fully-qualified hostnames of all AFS database server
machines or DFS Fileset Location (FL) Server machines for the cell named
by the B<-name> argument. If FL Server machines are specified, the local
machine must be running the AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit Protocol Translator.

=item B<-linkedcell> <I<linked cell name>>

Specifies the name of the AFS cell to link to a DCE cell for the purpose
of DFS fileset location.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 WINDOWS

The B<fs newcell> command on Windows differs from the Unix version in a few ways.

B<fs newcell> with no arguments discards the existing cell information.
The Windows client will reload a cell's information the next time it
needs the server list for a cell.

Secondly, in addition to accepting the Unix options, B<fs newcell> on
Windows accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item B<-dns>

Adds the new cell to the cache manager, and obtains the VLDB server
information from DNS.

=item B<-registry>

Adds the new cell to the cache manager, and also saves the cell
configuration data in the registry for use the next time the service
restarts.

=item B<-vlport> <I<cell VLDB server port>>

Specifies an alternate port number at which the cell's volume location
database servers are listening.

=item B<-fsport> <I<cell fileserver port>>

Specifies an alternate port number at which the cell's file servers are
listening.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example changes the machine's kernel-resident list of
database server machines for the ABC Corporation cell to include the
machines C<db1.abc.com> and C<db2.abc.com>:

   % fs newcell -name abc.com -servers db1.abc.com db2.abc.com

The following example links the DCE cell C<dce.abc.com> to the AFS cell
C<abc.com>. The AFS client contacts the Fileset Location (FL) servers
C<db1.dce.abc.com> and C<db2.dce.abc.com> for fileset location information
as it interprets a DFS pathname.

   % fs newcell -name dce.abc.com \
       -servers db1.dce.abc.com db2.dce.abc.com \
       -linkedcell abc.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the local superuser root.
