=head1 NAME

livesys - Reports the configured CPU/operating system type

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<livesys>

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<livesys> command displays the string stored in kernel memory that
indicates the local machine's CPU/operating system (OS) type,
conventionally called the I<sysname>.  The Cache Manager substitutes this
string for the I<@sys> variable which can occur in AFS pathnames; the
I<OpenAFS Quick Start Guides> and I<OpenAFS Administration Guide> explain
how using I<@sys> can simplify cell configuration.

To set a new value in kernel memory, use the B<fs sysname> command, which
can also be used to view the current value.  If a sysname list was set
using B<fs sysname>, only the first value in the list will be reported by
B<livesys>.

=head1 CAUTIONS

To see the full sysname list, use B<fs sysname> rather than this command.
B<livesys> is mostly useful for scripts that need to know the primary
sysname for the local system (to create directories that will later be
addressed using I<@sys>, for example).

B<livesys> first appeared in OpenAFS 1.2.2.  Scripts that need to support
older versions of AFS should parse the output of B<fs sysname> or use
B<sys>.

=head1 OUTPUT

The machine's system type appears as a text string, by itself, on a single
line.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows the output produced on a Linux system with a
2.6 kernel:

   % livesys
   i386_linux26
