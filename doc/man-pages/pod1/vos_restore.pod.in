=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos restore> command converts a volume dump file previously created
with the B<vos dump> command from ASCII into the volume format appropriate
for the machine type indicated by the B<-server> argument, and restores it
as a read/write volume to the partition named by the B<-partition>
argument on that machine. The Volume Server assigns the volume name
indicated with the B<-name> argument, and resets the volume's creation
timestamp to the time at which the restore operation begins (the creation
timestamp is stored in the volume header and reported in the C<Creation>
field in the output from the B<vos examine> and B<vos listvol> commands.)

Use the B<-file> argument to name the dump file, or omit the argument to
provide the file via the standard input stream, presumably through a
pipe. The pipe can be named, which enables interoperation with third-party
backup utilities.

As described in the following list, the command can create a completely
new volume or overwrite an existing volume. In all cases, the full dump of
the volume must be restored before any incremental dumps. If there are
multiple incremental dump files, they must be restored in the order they
were created.

=over 4

=item *

To create a new read/write volume, use the B<-name> argument to specify a
volume name that does not already exist in the Volume Location Database
(VLDB), and the B<-server> and B<-partition> arguments to specify the new
volume's site. It is best to omit the B<-id> argument so that the Volume
Location (VL) Server allocates a volume ID automatically. Do not include
the B<-overwrite> argument, because there is no existing volume to
overwrite.

=item *

To overwrite an existing volume at its current site, specify its name and
site with the B<-name>, B<-server>, and B<-partition> arguments. The
volume retains its current volume ID number unless the B<-id> argument is
provided. Specify the value C<f> or C<i> for the B<-overwrite> argument to
indicate whether the dump file is full or incremental, respectively.

=item *

To overwrite an existing volume and move it to a new site, specify its
name and the new site with the B<-name>, B<-server>, and B<-partition>
arguments. The volume retains its current volume ID number unless the
B<-id> argument is provided. The volume is removed from its original
site. Specify the value C<f> for the B<-overwrite> argument to indicate
that the dump file is a full dump (it is not possible to restore an
incremental dump and move the volume at the same time).

=back

If the volume named by the B<-name> argument already exists and the
B<-overwrite> argument is omitted, the command interpreter produces the
following prompt:

   Do you want to do a full/incremental restore or abort? [fia](a):

Respond by entering one of the following values:

=over 4

=item *

C<f> if restoring a full dump file

=item *

C<i> if restoring an incremental dump file

=item *

C<a> or Return to cancel the restore operation

=back

=head1 CAUTIONS

If the B<-file> argument is omitted, the issuer must provide all other
necessary arguments, because the standard input stream is unavailable for
responding to the command interpreter's prompts for missing
information. In particular, the issuer must provide the B<-overwrite>
argument if overwriting an existing volume.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<server name>>

Identifies the file server machine onto which to restore the
volume. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully
qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Identifies the partition (on the file server machine specified by the
B<-server> argument) onto which to restore the volume. Provide the
partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example, F</vicepa>)
or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated forms. For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-name> <I<name of volume>>

Specifies the name under which to restore the volume. It can be up to 22
characters long, but cannot end with a C<.readonly> or C<.backup>
extension. If the volume already exists, it is overwritten subject to the
value of the B<-overwrite> argument.

=item B<-file> <I<dump file>>

Names the dump file to restore. Incomplete pathnames are interpreted
relative to the current working directory. Omit this argument to provide
the dump file via the standard input stream.

=item B<-id> <I<volume ID>>

Specifies the volume ID number to assign to the restored volume.

=item B<-overwrite> (a | f | i)

Specifies which type of dump file is being restored when overwriting an
existing volume. Provide one of the following values:

=over 4

=item *

C<a> to terminate the restore operation.

=item *

C<f> if restoring a full dump file.

=item *

C<i> if restoring an incremental dump file. This value is not acceptable
if the B<-server> and B<-partition> arguments do not indicate the volume's
current site.

=back

This argument is mandatory if the B<-file> argument is not provided.

=item B<-offline>

Leaves the new volume flagged as off-line in the volume database.

=item B<-readonly>

Flags the new volume as read-only in the volume database.

=item B<-creation> <I<dump | keep | new>>

Set the creation date of the new volume to the timestamp from the
dumped volume (dump), from the target volume, if there is one (keep),
or generate a new one using the current time (new).

=item B<-lastupdate> <I<dump | keep | new>>

Set the last updated date of the new volume to the timestamp from the
dumped volume (dump), from the target volume, if there is one (keep),
or generate a new one using the current time (new).

=item B<-nodelete>

This option is available in OpenAFS clients 1.4.7 or
later and 1.5.31 or later. This option can be used with OpenAFS server
versions 1.4.1 or later and 1.5.0 or later.

=include fragments/vos-common.pod

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command restores the contents of the dump file
F</afs/example.com/common/dumps/terry.dump> to the F</vicepc> partition on the
file server machine C<fs3.example.com>. The restored volume is named
C<user.terry>.

   % cd /afs/example.com/common/dumps
   % vos restore -file terry.dump -server fs3.example.com -partition c \
       -name user.terry

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
