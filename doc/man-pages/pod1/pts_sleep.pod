=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts sleep> pauses for a specified number of seconds. The command can
be run from the command line or interactively, although from the command
line it's essentially equivalent to the B<sleep> command. It is intended
for use in interactive mode to pause for a few seconds between batch
commands to allow the Protection Server to catch up.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Prior to OpenAFS 1.4.5 and OpenAFS 1.5.23, the B<pts sleep> command was
only available on Unix or Linux and when OpenAFS was compiled with the
supergroups option (disabled by default).  As of OpenAFS 1.4.5 and 1.5.23,
it is always available.

=head1 OPTIONS

Although they have no effect, B<pts sleep> takes the following standard
B<pts> options:

=over 4

=item B<-delay> <I<# of seconds>>

Specifies the amount of time to sleep, in seconds.

=item B<-auth>

Use the calling user's tokens to communicate with the Protection Server. For
more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-config> <I<config directory>>

Use an alternate config directory. For more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-encrypt>

Encrypts any communication with the Protection Server. For more details, see
L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-force>

Enables the command to continue executing as far as possible when errors
or other problems occur, rather than halting execution at the first error.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> 
or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the issuer. For more
details, see L<pts(1)>.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT
