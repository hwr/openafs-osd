=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos rename> command changes the name of the read/write volume
specified with the B<-oldname> argument to the name specified with the
B<-newname> argument. The names of the read/write's read-only copies and
backup copy, if any, change automatically to match.

After issuing this command, remember to correct any mount points that
refer to the old volume name, by removing the old mount point with the
B<fs rmmount> command and creating a new one with the B<fs mkmount>
command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-oldname> <I<old volume name>>

Is the current name of the read/write volume.

=item B<-newname> <I<new volume name>>

Is the desired new name for the volume.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<vos> command interpreter presents it
to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument or
B<-noauth> flag. For more details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-verbose>

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the command's
execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings and error messages
appear.

=item B<-encrypt>

Encrypts the command so that the operation's results are not transmitted
across the network in clear text. This option is available in OpenAFS
versions 1.4.11 or later and 1.5.60 or later.

=item B<-noresolve>

Shows all servers as IP addresses instead of the DNS name. This is very
useful when the server address is registered as 127.0.0.1 or when dealing
with multi-homed servers. This option is available in OpenAFS
versions 1.4.8 or later and 1.5.35 or later.

=item B<-config> <I<configuration directory>>

Set the location of the configuration directory to be used. This defaults to
F</usr/vice/etc>, except if B<-localauth> is specified, in which case the
default is F</usr/afs/etc>. This option allows the use of alternative
configuration locations for testing purposes.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The B<vos rename> command produces no output if the command succeeds.

If the volume named by the B<-oldname> argument does not exist, the
following message appears:

   vos: Could not find entry for volume <old volume name>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example changes the mistaken volume name C<sun4x_56.afsws>
to the correct alternative C<sun4x_56.usr.afsws>.

   % vos rename -oldname sun4x_56.afsws -newname sun4x_56.usr.afsws

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
