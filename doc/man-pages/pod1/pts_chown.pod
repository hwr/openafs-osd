=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts chown> command designates the user or group named by the
B<-owner> argument as the owner of the group named by the B<-name>
argument, and records the new owner in the owner field of the group's
Protection Database entry.

In the case of regular groups, this command automatically changes the
group name's owner prefix (the part of the group name before the colon) to
match the new owner. If the new owner is itself a group, then only its
owner prefix, not its complete name, becomes the owner prefix in the new
name. The change to the owner prefix does not propagate to any groups
owned by the group, however. To make the owner prefix of such group-owned
groups reflect the new owning group, use the B<pts rename> command.

It is not possible to change a user or machine entry's owner from the
default set at creation time, the system:administrators group.

=head1 CAUTIONS

While designating a machine as a group's owner does not cause an error, it
is not recommended. The Protection Server does not extend the usual
privileges of group ownership to users logged onto the machine.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-name> <I<group name>>

Specifies the current name of the group to which to assign a new owner.

=item B<-owner> <I<new owner>>

Names the user or group to become the group's owner.

=item B<-auth>

Use the calling user's tokens to communicate with the Protection Server. For
more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-config> <I<config directory>>

Use an alternate config directory. For more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-encrypt>

Encrypts any communication with the Protection Server. For more details, see
L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-force>

Enables the command to continue executing as far as possible when errors
or other problems occur, rather than halting execution at the first error.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> 
or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see L<pts(1)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the issuer. For more
details, see L<pts(1)>.

changes to C<pat:friends>.

   % pts chown -name terry:friends -owner pat

The following example changes the owner of the group C<terry:friends> from
the user C<terry> to the group C<pat:buddies>. A side effect is that the
group name changes to C<pat:friends>.
