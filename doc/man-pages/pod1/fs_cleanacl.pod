=head1 NAME

fs_cleanacl - Remove obsolete entries from an ACL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<fs cleanacl> S<<< [B<-path> <I<dir/file path>>+] >>> [B<-help>]

B<fs cl> S<<< [B<-p> <I<dir/file path>>+] >>> [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fs cleanacl> command removes from the access control list (ACL) of
each specified directory or file any entry that refers to a user or group
that no longer has a Protection Database entry. Such an entry appears on
the ACL as an AFS user ID number (UID) rather than a name, because without
a Protection Database entry, the File Server cannot translate the UID into
a name.

Cleaning access control lists in this way not only keeps them from
becoming crowded with irrelevant information, but also prevents the new
possessor of a recycled AFS UID from obtaining access intended for the
former possessor of the AFS UID. (Note that recycling UIDs is not
recommended in any case.)

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-path> <I<dir/file path>>+

Names each directory for which to clean the ACL (specifying a filename
cleans its directory's ACL). If this argument is omitted, the current
working directory's ACL is cleaned.

Specify the read/write path to each directory, to avoid the failure that
results from attempting to change a read-only volume. By convention, the
read/write path is indicated by placing a period before the cell name at
the pathname's second level (for example, F</afs/.example.com>). For further
discussion of the concept of read/write and read-only paths through the
filespace, see the B<fs mkmount> reference page.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 OUTPUT

If there are no obsolete entries on the ACL, the following message
appears:

   Access list for <path> is fine.

Otherwise, the output reports the resulting state of the ACL, following the
header

   Access list for <path> is now

At the same time, the following error message appears for each file in the
cleaned directories:

   fs: '<filename>': Not a directory

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example illustrates the cleaning of the ACLs on the current
working directory and two of its subdirectories. Only the second
subdirectory had obsolete entries on it.

   % fs cleanacl -path . ./reports ./sources
   Access list for . is fine.
   Access list for ./reports is fine.
   Access list for ./sources is now
   Normal rights:
      system:authuser rl
      pat rlidwka

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the C<a> (administer) permission on each directory's
ACL (or the ACL of each file's parent directory); the directory's owner
and the members of the system:administrators group have the right
implicitly, even if it does not appear on the ACL.
