=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos unlock> command releases the lock on the Volume Location
Database (VLDB) entry for the indicated volume.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Do not user this command under normal circumstances.

It is useful if the VLDB entry is locked but there is no reason to suspect
inconsistency within the volume or between it and the VLDB. Note that it
is possible to list information from locked VLDB entries, even though they
cannot be manipulated in other ways.

The B<vos unlockvldb> command unlocks several VLDB entries at once, or
even the entire VLDB. The B<vos lock> command locks a VLDB entry so that
no one else can perform an action that requires writing the VLDB.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-id> <I<volume name or ID>>

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of a volume of any
of the three types.

=head1 EXAMPLES

   % vos unlock user.terry

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
