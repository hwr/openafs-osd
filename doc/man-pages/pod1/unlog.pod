=head1 NAME

unlog - Discards all of the issuer's tokens

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<unlog> S<<< [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>+] >>> [B<-help>]

B<unlog> [B<-c ><I<cell name>>+] [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<unlog> command by default discards all tokens that the issuer
currently holds. To discard tokens for certain cells only, name them with
the B<-cell> argument.

Since a token pertains to one client machine only, destroying tokens on
one machine has no effect on tokens on another machine.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Specifying one or more cell names can cause a brief authentication outage
during which the issuer has no valid tokens in any cell. This is because
the command actually discards all tokens and then restores the ones for
cells not named by the B<-cell> argument. The outage can sometimes
interrupt the operation of jobs that require authentication.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>+

Specifies each cell for to discard the token. If this argument is omitted,
the Cache Manager discards all tokens. Provide the fully qualified domain
name, or a shortened form, in which case successful resolution depends on
the availability of a name resolution service (such as the Domain Name
Service or a local host table) at the time the command is issued.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
