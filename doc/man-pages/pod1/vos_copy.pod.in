=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos copy> command makes a copy of a volume with a new name.  It is
equivalent to B<vos dump> followed by B<vos restore>, but doesn't require
the volume be stored locally by the client.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-id> <I<volume name or ID>>

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of a read/write
volume.

=item B<-fromserver> <I<machine name for source>>

Identifies the file server machine where the source volume resides. Provide
the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully qualified or using
an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-frompartition> <I<partition name for source>>

Names the partition where the source volume resides. Provide the full
partition name (for, example, B</vicepa>) or one of the abbreviated forms
described in L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-toname> <I<volume name for new copy>>

The complete name of the new volume to create.

=item B<-toserver> <I<machine name for destination>>

Identifies the file server machine to which to copy the volume.  Provide
the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully qualified or using
an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-topartition> <I<partition name for destination>>

Names the partition to which to copy the volume. Provide the full partition
name (for, example, B</vicepa>) or one of the abbreviated forms described in
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-offline>

Leaves the new volume flagged as off-line in the volume database.

=item B<-readonly>

Flags the new volume as read-only in the volume database.

=item B<-live>

Copies the live volume without cloning.  This is normally not necessary and
causes the volume to be kept locked for longer than the normal copy
mechanism.

=head1 OUTPUT

This command has no output unless C<-verbose> is specified or there is
an error.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example makes a verbose copy of the C<test> volume named
C<test2> in the cell C<localcell>. The volume and copy both reside on
C</vicepa> of C<server1>.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
