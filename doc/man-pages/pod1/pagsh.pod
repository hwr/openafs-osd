B<pagsh.krb>

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pagsh> command creates a new command shell (owned by the issuer of
the command) and associates a new I<process authentication group> (PAG)
with the shell and the user. A PAG is a number guaranteed to identify the
issuer of commands in the new shell uniquely to the local Cache
Manager. The PAG is used, instead of the issuer's UNIX UID, to identify
the issuer in the credential structure that the Cache Manager creates to
track each user.

Any tokens acquired subsequently (presumably for other cells) become
associated with the PAG, rather than with the user's UNIX UID.  This
method for distinguishing users has two advantages:

=over 2

=item *

It means that processes spawned by the user inherit the PAG and so share
the token; thus they gain access to AFS as the authenticated user.  In
many environments, for example, printer and other daemons run under
identities (such as the local superuser C<root>) that the AFS server
processes recognize only as C<anonymous>. Unless PAGs are used, such
daemons cannot access files in directories whose access control lists
(ACLs) do not extend permissions to the system:anyuser group.

=item *

It closes a potential security loophole: UNIX allows anyone already logged
in as the local superuser C<root> on a machine to assume any other
identity by issuing the UNIX B<su> command. If the credential structure is
identified by a UNIX UID rather than a PAG, then the local superuser
C<root> can assume a UNIX UID and use any tokens associated with that
UID. Use of a PAG as an identifier eliminates that possibility.

=back

The (mostly obsolete) B<pagsh.krb> command is the same as B<pagsh> except
that it also sets the KRBTKFILE environment variable, which controls the
default Kerberos v4 ticket cache, to F</tmp/tktpI<X>> where I<X> is the
number of the user's PAG.  This is only useful for AFS cells still using
Kerberos v4 outside of AFS and has no effect for cells using Kerberos v5
and B<aklog> or B<klog.krb5>.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Each PAG created uses two of the memory slots that the kernel uses to
record the UNIX groups associated with a user. If none of these slots are
available, the B<pagsh> command fails. This is not a problem with most
operating systems, which make at least 16 slots available per user.

In cells that do not use an AFS-modified login utility, use this command
to obtain a PAG before issuing the B<klog> command (or include the
B<-setpag> argument to the B<klog> command). If a PAG is not acquired, the
Cache Manager stores the token in a credential structure identified by
local UID rather than PAG. This creates the potential security exposure
described in L</DESCRIPTION>.

If users of NFS client machines for which AFS is supported are to issue
this command as part of authenticating with AFS, do not use the B<fs
exportafs> command's B<-uidcheck on> argument to enable UID checking on
NFS/AFS Translator machines. Enabling UID checking prevents this command
from succeeding. See L<klog(1)>.

If UID checking is not enabled on Translator machines, then by default it
is possible to issue this command on a properly configured NFS client
machine that is accessing AFS via the NFS/AFS Translator, assuming that
the NFS client machine is a supported system type. The B<pagsh> binary
accessed by the NFS client must be owned by, and grant setuid privilege
to, the local superuser C<root>. The complete set of mode bits must be
C<-rwsr-xr-x>. This is not a requirement when the command is issued on AFS
client machines.

However, if the translator machine's administrator has enabled UID
checking by including the B<-uidcheck on> argument to the B<fs exportafs>
command, the command fails with an error message similar to the following:

   Warning: Remote setpag to <translator_machine> has failed (err=8). . .
   setpag: Exec format error

=head1 EXAMPLES

In the following example, the issuer invokes the C shell instead of the
default Bourne shell:

   # pagsh -c /bin/csh
