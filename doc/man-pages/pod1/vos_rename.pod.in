=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos rename> command changes the name of the read/write volume
specified with the B<-oldname> argument to the name specified with the
B<-newname> argument. The names of the read/write's read-only copies and
backup copy, if any, change automatically to match.

After issuing this command, remember to correct any mount points that
refer to the old volume name, by removing the old mount point with the
B<fs rmmount> command and creating a new one with the B<fs mkmount>
command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-oldname> <I<old volume name>>

Is the current name of the read/write volume.

=item B<-newname> <I<new volume name>>

Is the desired new name for the volume.

=head1 OUTPUT

The B<vos rename> command produces no output if the command succeeds.

If the volume named by the B<-oldname> argument does not exist, the
following message appears:

   vos: Could not find entry for volume <old volume name>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example changes the mistaken volume name C<sun4x_56.afsws>
to the correct alternative C<sun4x_56.usr.afsws>.

   % vos rename -oldname sun4x_56.afsws -newname sun4x_56.usr.afsws

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
