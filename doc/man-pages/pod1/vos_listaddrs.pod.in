=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos listaddrs> command displays all of the server entries from the
Volume Location Database (VLDB). An entry is created as the File Server
initializes and registers the contents of its F</usr/afs/local/sysid> file
in the VLDB.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-host> <I<address of host>>

Rather than displaying all the server entries, display only server entries
for the specified host. This will show all multihomed addresses registered
by that File Server in the VLDB.

=item B<-uuid> <I<uuid of server>>

Rather than displaying all the server entries, display only server entries
for the File Server with the specified UUID. This will show all multihomed
addresses registered by that File Server in the VLDB and also allows
mapping a File Server UUID to its address.

=item B<-printuuid>

Prints the UUID of server entries in addition to the registered
addresses. The B<-printuuid> option is available in OpenAFS versions 1.4.5
or later and 1.5.8 or later.

=head1 OUTPUT

The output displays all server entries from the VLDB, each on its own
line. If a file server machine is multihomed, all of its registered
addresses appear on the line. The first one is the one reported as a
volume's site in the output from the B<vos examine> and B<vos listvldb>
commands.

The VLDB records IP addresses, and the command interpreter has the local
name service (either a process like the Domain Name Service or a local
host table) translate them to hostnames before displaying them. If an IP
address appears in the output, it is not possible to translate it.

The existence of an entry does not necessarily indicate that the machine
that is still an active file server machine. To remove obsolete server
entries, use the B<vos changeaddr> command with the B<-remove> argument.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command displays the VLDB server entries in the Example
Corporation cell:

   % vos listaddrs
   sv5.example.com
   sv1.example.com
   sv2.example.com  afs2.example.com
   sv6.example.com

The following command displays the VLDB server entry and UUID for
host sv5.example.com in the Example Corporation cell:

   % vos listaddrs -p -ho sv5.example.com
   UUID: 000c5aff-8246-1699-96-c4-437b5a45aa77
   sv5.example.com
