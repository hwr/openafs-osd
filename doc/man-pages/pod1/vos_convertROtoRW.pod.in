=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<vos convertROtoRW> converts a Read-Only volume into a Read/Write volume
when the original Read/Write volume is no longer available.  It's normal use
is to recover the Read/Write volume from a replica after a failed disk,
failed server, or accidental deletion.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The command name is case-sensitive.  It must be issued with the capital "RO"
and "RW".

After running vos convertROtoRW, the old file server will still contain
the old Read/Write copy of the volume, even if the VLDB no longer
references it. You can view the old volume with B<vos listvol>, and you
should remove the old copy (for example, with B<vos zap>) so that the
original file server will match the VLDB.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<server name>>

Identifies the file server machine that houses the Read-Only volume which
will be converted.  Provide the machine's IP address or its host name
(either fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation).  For details,
see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Identifies the partition on the file server machine that houses the
Read-Only volume which will be converted.  Provide the full partition name
(for, example, B</vicepa>) or one of the abbreviated forms described in
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-id> <I<volume ID>>

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of a Read/Write
volume.

=item B<-force>

Don't ask for confirmation.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example converts the read-only volume test3.readonly in
partition vicepb on server1 to a read-write volume:

   % vos convertROtoRW server1 b test3.readonly

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and
on each database server machine.  If the B<-localauth> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser C<root>.
