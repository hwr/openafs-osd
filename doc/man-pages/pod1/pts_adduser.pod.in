=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts adduser> command adds each user or machine entry named by the
B<-user> argument as a member of each group named by the B<-group>
argument.

To remove members of a group, use the B<pts removeuser> command. To list
the groups to which a user or machine belongs, or the members of a
specified group, use the B<pts membership> command.

=head1 CAUTIONS

After being added as a group member, a currently authenticated user must
reauthenticate (for example, by issuing the B<aklog> or B<klog.krb5> commands)
to obtain permissions granted to the group on an access control list (ACL).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-user> <I<user name>>+

Specifies the name of each user or machine entry to add to each group
named by the B<-group> argument. The name of a machine entry resembles an
IP address and can use the wildcard notation described on the B<pts
createuser> reference page. The user or machine entry must already exist
in the Protection Database.

=item B<-group> <I<group name>>+

Specifies the complete name (including the owner prefix if applicable) of
each group to which to add members. The group entry must already exist in
the Protection Database.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example adds user smith to the group system:administrators.

   % pts adduser -user smith -group system:administrators

The following example adds users C<jones>, C<terry>, and B<pat> to the
smith:colleagues group.

   % pts adduser -user jones terry pat -group smith:colleagues

The following example adds the machine entries in the Example Corporation
subnet to the group C<bin-prot>. Because of the IP address range of the
Example Corporation subnet, the system administrator was able to group the
machines into three machine entries (using the wildcard notation discussed
on the B<pts createuser> reference page).

   % pts adduser -user 138.255.0.0 192.12.105.0 192.12.106.0 -group bin-prot

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The required privilege depends on the setting of the fourth privacy flag
in the Protection Database entry for each group named by the B<-group>
argument (use the B<pts examine> command to display the flags):

=over 4

=item *

If it is the hyphen, only the group's owner and members of the
system:administrators group can add members.

=item *

If it is lowercase C<a>, current members of the group can add new members.

=item *

If it is uppercase C<A>, anyone who can access the cell's database server
machines can add new members.
