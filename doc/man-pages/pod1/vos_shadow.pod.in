=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos shadow> command creates a shadow copy of a volume on a
different partition or server.

A shadow volume is a copy of a volume that does not normally appear in
the volume location database (VLDB). It is a primitive operation that
is meant to be used in backup or disaster recovery situations.

=head1 CAUTIONS

This command is not used during normal OpenAFS administration and may
have adverse effects on the VLDB if not used properly! This command
should only be used by an expert.

Using this command on a volume when the source volume is not the same
as parent volume used to create the shadow will leave the destination
volume in a unknown state.

Running B<vos syncserv> or B<vos syncvldb> on a fileserver containing 
shadow volumes will not update the VLDB with the shadowed Read/Write
volumes as long as the entries for the source volumes still exist. In
a disaster recovery situation the VLDB entries for the corresponding
source volumes need hence to be deleted first.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-id> <I<volume name or ID>>

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of a read/write
volume.

=item B<-fromserver> <I<machine name for source>>

Identifies the file server machine where the source volume resides. Provide
the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully qualified or using
an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-frompartition> <I<partition name for source>>

Names the partition where the source volume resides. Provide the full
partition name (for, example, B</vicepa>) or one of the abbreviated forms
described in L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-toserver> <I<machine name for destination>>

Identifies the file server machine to which to copy the volume.  Provide
the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully qualified or using
an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-topartition> <I<partition name for destination>>

Names the partition to which to copy the volume. Provide the full partition
name (for, example, B</vicepa>) or one of the abbreviated forms described in
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-toname> <I<volume name for new copy>>

The complete name of the new volume to create.

=item B<-toid> <I<volume ID for new copy>>

The volume ID number to use for the new volume.

=item B<-offline>

Leaves the new volume flagged as off-line in the volume database.

=item B<-readonly>

Flags the new volume as read-only in the volume database.

=item B<-live>

Copies the live volume without cloning.  This is normally not necessary and
causes the volume to be kept locked for longer than the normal copy
mechanism.

=item B<-incremental>

Copy the changes from the source volume to a previously created shadow
volume.

=head1 OUTPUT

This command has no output unless C<-verbose> is specified or there is
an error.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machines specified with the B<-toserver> and B<-fromserver> arguments and
on each database server machine.  If the B<-localauth> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser C<root>.
