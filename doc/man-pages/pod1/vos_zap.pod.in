=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos zap> command removes the volume with the specified I<volume ID>
from the site defined by the B<-server> and B<-partition> arguments,
without attempting to change the corresponding Volume Location Database
(VLDB) entry. If removing the volume can possibly result in incorrect data
in the VLDB, a warning message is displayed.

The B<-force> flag removes a volume even if it cannot be "attached"
(brought online), which can happen either because the volume is extremely
damaged or because the Salvager functioned abnormally. Without this flag,
this command cannot remove volumes that are not attachable. See also
L</CAUTIONS>.

To remove the specified read/write volume's backup version at the same
time, include the B<-backup> flag.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Do not use this command as the standard way to remove a volume, as it is
likely to put the VLDB out of sync with the volumes on servers. Use the
B<vos remove> command instead.

This command is useful in situations where it is important to delete the
volume, but for some reason the VLDB is unreachable -- for example,
because the Volume Location Server is unavailable. The issuer can remove
the VLDB entry later with the B<vos remove> or B<vos delentry> command, or
it is removed automatically when the B<vos syncserv> and B<vos syncvldb>
commands run.

To remove a read-only site defined in the VLDB by mistake, before a copy
actually exists at the site, use the B<vos remsite> command. To remove an
entire VLDB entry without affecting volumes at their sites, use the B<vos
delentry> command.

Do not use the B<-force> flag if the volume is online, but only when
attempts to remove the volume with the B<vos remove> or the B<vos zap>
command have failed, or the volume definitely cannot be attached. After
using the B<-force> flag, make sure that the volume's VLDB entry is also
removed (issue the B<vos delentry> command if necessary).

Adding the B<-force> flag makes the command take considerably longer --
about as long as a salvage of the relevant partition -- since the Volume
Server examines all inodes on the partition for traces of the volume.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<server name>>

Identifies the file server machine from which to remove the volume.
Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully qualified
or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Identifies the partition (on the file server machine specified by the
B<-server> argument) from which to remove the volume. Provide the
partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example, C</vicepa>)
or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated forms. For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-id> <I<volume ID>>

Specifies the volume ID number of the volume to remove, which can be of
any of the three types. The volume name is not acceptable.

=item B<-force>

Removes the volume even though it cannot be attached (brought online). Use
only after the failure of previous attempts to remove the volume by using
the B<vos remove> command or the B<vos zap> command without this flag.

=item B<-backup>

Removes the backup version of the read/write volume specified by the
B<-id> argument. Do not use this flag if the B<-id> argument identifies a
read-only or backup volume.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example removes the volume with volume ID 536870988 from the
F</vicepf> partition of the file server machine C<fs6.example.com>, without
noting the change in the VLDB.

   % vos zap -server fs6.example.com -partition f -id 536870988

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
