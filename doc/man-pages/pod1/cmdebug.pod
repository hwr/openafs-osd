=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<cmdebug> command displays information about the Cache Manager
and client cache status on a local or remote AFS client machine.  By
default, it displays all locked cache entries, but other information
can be requested via various options.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<-ctime> option is only available with OpenAFS version 1.4.7 and
later or version 1.5.28 or later.  This option can be used to gather
information from any version of the Unix OpenAFS client, but can only
query Windows clients running OpenAFS version 1.5.28 or later.

The B<-cellservdb> option is only available with OpenAFS version 1.4.7
and later or version 1.5.31 or later.  This option can be used to gather
information from any version of the Unix OpenAFS client, but can only
query Windows clients running OpenAFS version 1.5.31 or later.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-servers> <I<machine>>

Names the client machine for which to display Cache Manager status.
Provide the machine's IP address in dotted decimal format, its fully
qualified host name (for example, B<fs1.example.com>), or the shortest
abbreviated form of its host name that distinguishes it from other
machines. Successful use of an abbreviated form depends on the
availability of a name resolution service (such as the Domain Name
Service or a local host table) at the time the command is issued.

=item B<-port> <I<IP port>>

Identifies the port on which to contact the Cache Manager.  By default,
the standard port 7001 is used, so this option is very rarely needed.

=item B<-long>

Reports on all lock statuses and all cache entries, rather than only
locked cache entries.  Do not use this option with B<-refcounts>,
B<-callbacks>, B<-addrs>, B<-cache>, or B<-cellservdb>.

=item B<-refcounts>

Reports only those cache entries with non-zero reference counts.  Do not
use this option with B<-long>, B<-callbacks>, B<-addrs>, or B<-cache>.

=item B<-callbacks>

Reports only those cache entries with callbacks.  Do not use this option
with B<-long>, B<-refcounts>, B<-addrs>, or B<-cache>.

=item B<-ctime>

Causes entry expiration times to be shown in human-readable format. Do
not use this option with B<-addrs> or B<-cache>.

=item B<-addrs>

Rather than showing any cache entries, displays the interfaces the Cache
Manager answers on, including their netmasks and MTUs.  This is useful for
analyzing clients that are multihomed and identifying problems with
netmasks or MTU settings.  Do not use this option with B<-long>,
B<-refcounts>, B<-callbacks>, or B<-cache>.

=item B<-cache>

Rather than showing any cache entries, displays the cache configuration
for the client machine.  The information displayed is essentially the
information that can be configured via parameters to B<afsd>.  Do not use
this option with B<-long>, B<-refcounts>, B<-callbacks>, or B<-addrs>.

=item B<-cellservdb>

Lists all known volume location database records in a
CellServDB-compatible format. This includes all records in memory,
including those from the CellServDB file, DNS SRV or AFSDB records, and
the B<fs newcell> command. This option could be used to see if a client
has the latest copy of the CellServDB file. Do not use this option
with B<-long>, B<-refcounts>, B<-callbacks>, or B<-cache>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Displays all of the locked cache entries on C<client1>:

    % cmdebug client1

Displays the cache configuration for C<client1.example.com>:

    % cmdebug client1.example.com -cache

Displays all cache entries for C<client2.example.com>:

    % cmdebug client2.example.com -long
