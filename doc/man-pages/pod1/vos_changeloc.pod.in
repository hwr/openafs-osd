=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos changeloc> command changes the location of a volume in the
Volume Location Database (VLDB) without needing to contact the original
file server on which the volume was hosted. This is useful when a file
server has gone down permanently and the data that was stored on that
server has been moved to a new file server with a different name and IP
address (perhaps by mounting the same /vicepX partitions on a different
host). After moving the data and running B<vos changeloc>, run B<vos
syncvldb> and then B<vos syncserv> against the new server to ensure full
synchronization of the VLDB with the file server.

In essence, B<vos changeloc> performs the same operations on the VLDB as
B<vos move>, but it does NOT move the data from one server's file system
to another.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Using B<vos changeloc> changes the VLDB without modifying the file server
data, so it inherently causes the VLDB to be out of sync with the data on
the servers. It should only be used when recovering from server failure.
If the servers are on-line, B<vos move> should be used instead. It is
highly recommended that B<vos syncvldb> and B<vos syncserv> be run after
using the B<vos changeloc> command to ensure properly synchronization of
the VLDB with the file servers.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<vos changeloc> takes the following options:

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<new server name>>

Specifies the new server where the VLDB should believe the volume resides.
Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully qualified
or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Specifies the partition where the VLDB should believe the volume resides.
Provide the B<-server> argument along with this one. Provide the
partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example, C</vicepa>)
or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated forms. For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-id> <I<volume name or ID>>

Specifies the name or volume ID number on which to operate.

=head1 OUTPUT

B<vos changeloc> shows a brief message upon completion:

   Changed location to server2 /vicepa for volume user.jdoe

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command changes the location of the C<user.jdoe> volume to
be F</vicepa> on the file server machine C<server2> while being verbose:

   % vos changeloc server2 a user.jdoe -verbose
    done
   Changed location to server2 /vicepa for volume user.jdoe

The following command changes the location of the C<user.jdoe> volume to
be F</vicepa> on C<server1> without being verbose:

   % vos changeloc server1 a user.jdoe
   Changed location to server1 /vicepa for volume user.jdoe

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on each
database server machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer
must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local superuser
C<root>.
