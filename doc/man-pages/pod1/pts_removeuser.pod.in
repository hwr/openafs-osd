=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts removeuser> command removes each user or machine named by the
B<-user> argument from each group named by the B<-group> argument.

To add users to a group, use the B<pts adduser> command. To list group
membership, use the B<pts membership> command. To remove users from a
group and delete the group's entry completely in a single step, use the
B<pts delete> command.

=head1 CAUTIONS

AFS compiles each user's group membership as he or she authenticates. Any
users who have valid tokens when they are removed from a group retain the
privileges extended to that group's members until they discard their
tokens or reauthenticate.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-user> <I<user name>>+

Specifies the name of each user entry or the IP address (complete or
wildcard-style) of each machine entry to remove.

=item B<-group> <I<group name>>+

Names each group from which to remove members.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example removes user smith from the groups C<staff> and
C<staff:finance>. Note that no switch names are necessary because only a
single instance is provided for the first argument (the username).

   % pts removeuser smith staff staff:finance

The following example removes three machine entries, which represent all
machines in the Example Corporation network, from the group C<bin-prot>:

   % pts removeuser -user 138.255.0.0 192.12.105.0 192.12.106.0 -group bin-prot

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The required privilege depends on the setting of the fifth privacy flag in
the Protection Database for the group named by the B<-group> argument (use
the B<pts examine> command to display the flags):

=over 4

=item *

If it is the hyphen, only the group's owner and members of the
system:administrators group can remove members.

=item *

If it is lowercase C<r>, members of the group can also remove other
members.

=back

(It is not possible to set the fifth flag to uppercase C<R>.)
