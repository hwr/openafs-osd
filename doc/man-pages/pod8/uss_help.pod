=head1 NAME

uss_help - Displays help for uss commands (deprecated)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<uss help> S<<< [B<-topic> <I<help string>>+] >>> [B<-help>]

B<uss h> S<<< [B<-t> <I<help string>>+] >>> [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<uss> command suite is currently designed for cells using the
obsolete Authentication Server, and therefore is primarily useful for
sites that have not yet migrated to a Kerberos version 5 KDC. The
Authentication Server and supporting commands will be removed in a future
version of OpenAFS, which may include B<uss> unless someone who finds it
useful converts it to work with a Kerberos version 5 KDC.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<uss help> command displays the complete online help entry (short
description and syntax statement) for each command operation code
specified by the B<-topic> argument. If the B<-topic> argument is omitted,
the output includes the first line (name and short description) of the
online help entry for every B<uss> command.

To list every uss command whose name or short description includes a
specified keyword, use the B<uss apropos> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-topic> <I<help string>>+

Indicates each command for which to display the complete online help
entry. Omit the B<uss> part of the command name, providing only the
operation code (for example, specify B<bulk>, not B<uss bulk>). If this
argument is omitted, the output briefly describes every B<uss> command.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The online help entry for each uss command consists of the following two
or three lines:

=over 4

=item *

The first line names the command and briefly describes its function.

=item *

The second line lists aliases for the command, if any.

=item *

The final line, which begins with the string C<Usage>, lists the command's
options in the prescribed order. Online help entries use the same symbols
(for example, brackets) as the reference pages in this document.
