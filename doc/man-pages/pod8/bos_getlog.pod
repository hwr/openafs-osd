=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos getlog> command displays on the standard output stream the
specified log file from the machine named by the B<-server> argument. The
BOS Server fetches the log file from the F</usr/afs/logs> directory unless
an alternate pathname is provided as part of the B<-file> argument.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Log files can grow quite large, especially for the database server
processes. To keep them to a manageable size, periodically either use the
UNIX B<rm> command to truncate each log file, or use the B<bos restart>
command to restart each process.

It can take up to five minutes after the file is removed or process
restarted for the space occupied by a log file to become available.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine from which to retrieve the log file.
Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either
fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-file> <I<log file to examine>>

Names the log file to display. If a filename only is provided, the BOS
Server fetches the log file from the F</usr/afs/logs> directory; the
standard values are:

=over 4

=item F<AuthLog>

The Authentication Server (B<kaserver>) log file.

=item F<BackupLog>

The Backup Server (B<buserver>) log file.

=item F<BosLog>

The BOS Server (B<bosserver>) log file.

=item F<FileLog>

The File Server (B<fileserver>) log file.

=item F<SalvageLog>

The Salvager (B<salvager>) log file.

=item F<VLLog>

The Volume Location (VL) Server (B<vlserver>) log file.

=item F<VolserLog>

The Volume Server (B<volserver>) log file.

=back

If a pathname and filename are provided, the log file is retrieved from
the indicated directory. Partial pathnames are interpreted relative to the
F</usr/afs/logs> directory.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The output is preceded by the line

   Fetching log file '<filename>'...

The remainder of the output depends on the particular log file.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example displays the FileLog file from the machine
C<fs3.example.com>:

   % bos getlog -server fs3.example.com -file FileLog
   Fetching log file 'FileLog'...
   Sun Nov 8 04:00:34 1998 File server starting
   Sun Nov 8 04:00:39 1998 Partition /vicepa:  attached 21 volumes;
                           0 volumes not attached
   Sun Nov 8 04:00:40 1998 File Server started Sun Nov 8 04:00:40

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.

When a server is in restricted mode, B<bos getlog> B<-file> may only
specify files from the logs directory.
