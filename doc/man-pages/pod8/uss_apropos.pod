=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<uss> command suite is currently designed for cells using the
obsolete Authentication Server, and therefore is primarily useful for
sites that have not yet migrated to a Kerberos version 5 KDC. The
Authentication Server and supporting commands will be removed in a future
version of OpenAFS, which may include B<uss> unless someone who finds it
useful converts it to work with a Kerberos version 5 KDC.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<uss apropos> command displays the first line of the online help
entry for any B<uss> command that has in its name or short description the
string specified by the B<-topic> argument.

To display the syntax for a command, use the B<uss help> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-topic> <I<help string>>+

string is more than a single word, surround it with double quotes (C<"">)
or other delimiters.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT
