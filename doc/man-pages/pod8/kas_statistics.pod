=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<kas statistics> command displays statistics from the Authentication
Server running on one of the cell's database server machines. Use the
B<-servers> argument to name a specific machine, or the command
interpreter chooses one at random from all the database server machines
with which it has established connections.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<-servers> argument is not available in interactive mode, making it
impossible to specify a certain machine.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-admin_username> <I<admin principal>>

Specifies the user identity under which to authenticate with the
Authentication Server for execution of the command. For more details, see
L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-password_for_admin> <I<admin password>>

Specifies the password of the command's issuer. If it is omitted (as
recommended), the B<kas> command interpreter prompts for it and does not
echo it visibly. For more details, see L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-servers> <I<authentication servers>>+

Names each machine running an Authentication Server with which to
establish a connection. For more details, see L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. For more
details, see L<kas(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 OUTPUT

The information in the output includes:

=over 4

=item *

The number of allocation and freeing operations the Authentication Server
has performed, and how many password change requests it has processed.

=item *

An indication of its hash table use.

=item *

The server machine's IP address in hexadecimal and the date when the
current instance of the Authentication Server started.

=item *

The number of requests and aborted requests for various services:
authentication, ticket granting, password setting, entry listing, and so
on.

=item *

The amount of CPU time that the Authentication Server has used to process
requests since it started. The amount is not accurate on all system types,
however.

=item *

The number of entries in the Authentication Database that are marked with
the C<ADMIN> flag.

=head1 EXAMPLES

In the following example, an administrator using the admin account gathers
statistics from the Authentication Server running on the machine
C<fs1.example.com>.

   % kas statistics -servers fs1.example.com
   56 allocs, 46 frees, 0 password changes
   Hash table utilization = 0.100000%
   From host bfff21a7 started at Tue Mar 23 12:42:02 1999:
     of 88 requests for Authenticate, 18 were aborted.
     of 14 requests for GetTicket, 0 were aborted.
     of 4 requests for CreateUser, 1 were aborted.
     of 12 requests for SetFields, 4 were aborted.
     of 3 requests for DeleteUser, 0 were aborted.
     of 23 requests for GetEntry, 4 were aborted.
     of 18 requests for ListEntry, 0 were aborted.
     of 2 requests for GetStats, 1 were aborted.
