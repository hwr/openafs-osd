=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<kadb_check> command checks the integrity of the Authentication
Database, reporting any errors or corruption it finds. If there are
problems, do not issue any B<kas> commands until the database is repaired.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<kadb_check> command is only used with the database used by the
obsolete Authentication Server, which should no longer be used. It is
provided for sites that have not yet migrated to a Kerberos version 5
KDC. The Authentication Server and supporting commands, including B<kdb>,
will be removed in a future version of OpenAFS.

The results can be unpredictable if the Authentication Server makes
changes to the Authentication Database while this command is running. Use
the B<bos shutdown> command to shutdown the local B<kaserver> process
before running this command, or before creating a second copy of the
F<kaserver.DB0> file (with a different name) on which to run the command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-database> <I<kadb file>>

Names the Authentication Database (copy of the F<kaserver.DB0> file) to
check. If the current working directory is not the location of the file,
provide a pathname, either full or relative to the current working
directory.

=item B<-uheader>

Displays information which Ubik maintains in the database's header.

=item B<-kheader>

Displays information which the Authentication Server maintains in the
database's header.

=item B<-entries>

Outputs every entry in the database, providing information similar to that
returned by the B<kas examine> command.

=item B<-verbose>

Reports additional information about the database, including the number of
free (allocated but unused) entries in the database.

=item B<-rebuild> <I<out file>>

Names the file in which to record a list of B<kas> commands which, if
issued in the command shell, recreate the current state of the database
being verified. Partial pathnames are interpreted relative to the current
working directory.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If there are errors in the database, the output always reports them on the
standard error stream. If any options other than B<-database> or B<-help>
are provided, the output written to the standard output stream includes
additional information as described for each option in L</OPTIONS>.  The
output is intended for debugging purposes and is meaningful to someone
familiar with the internal structure of the Authentication Database.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the local superuser C<root>.
