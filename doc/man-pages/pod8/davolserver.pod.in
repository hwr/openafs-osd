=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<davolserver> command initializes the Volume Server component of the
C<dafs> process. In the conventional configuration, its binary file is
located in the F</usr/afs/bin> directory on a file server machine.

The B<davolserver> command is not normally issued at the command shell
prompt but rather placed into a file server machine's
F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file with the B<bos create> command. If it is
ever issued at the command shell prompt, the issuer must be logged onto a
database server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
