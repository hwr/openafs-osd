=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup addhost> command creates a Tape Coordinator entry in the
Backup Database. The entry records

=over 4

=item *

The host name of the Tape Coordinator machine where the Tape Coordinator
(B<butc>) process runs, as specified with the B<-tapehost> argument.

=item *

The Tape Coordinator's port offset number, as specified with the
B<-portoffset> argument. An entry for the port offset must also appear in
the F</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file on the Tape Coordinator machine,
where it is mapped to a UNIX device name (for a tape device) or pathname
(for a backup data file).

=back

Each Tape Coordinator must have its own port offset number, and the
command fails if a Backup Database entry already exists for the requested
port offset number. To display existing Tape Coordinator entries, use the
B<backup listhosts> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-tapehost> <I<tape machine name>>

Specifies the fully-qualified hostname of the machine for which to create
a Tape Coordinator entry in the Backup Database. The machine must have an
entry in either the cell's naming service (such as the Domain Name
Service) or the host file (F</etc/hosts> or equivalent) on the machine
where the command is issued.

=item B<-portoffset> <I<TC port offset>>

Specifies the Tape Coordinator's port offset number. Provide an integer
from the range C<0> through C<58510>, or omit this argument to use the
default value of C<0> (zero). The value must match the port offset number
recorded for the same combination of Tape Coordinator and tape device or
file in the F</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file on the Tape Coordinator
machine named by the B<-tapehost> argument.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command creates an entry in the Backup Database that assigns
port offset number 4 to a Tape Coordinator running on the machine
C<backup1.example.com>:

   % backup addhost -tapehost backup1.example.com -portoffset 4

The following command creates a Backup Database entry that assigns port
offset number 0 to a Tape Coordinator on the machine C<backup3.example.com>:

   % backup addhost backup3.example.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on every
machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
