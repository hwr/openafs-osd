=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<prdb_check> command checks the integrity of the Protection Database,
reporting any errors or corruption it finds. If there are problems, do not
issue any B<pts> commands until the database is repaired.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The results can be unpredictable if the Protection Server makes changes to
the Protection Database while this command is running. Use the B<bos
shutdown> command to shutdown the local B<ptserver> process before running
this command, or before creating a second copy of the F<prdb.DB0> file
(with a different name) on which to run the command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-database> <I<ptdb file>>

Names the Protection Database (copy of the F<prdb.DB0> file) to check. If
the current working directory is not the location of the file, provide a
pathname, either full or relative to the current working directory.

=item B<-uheader>

Displays information which Ubik maintains in the database's header.

=item B<-pheader>

Displays information which the Protection Server maintains in the
database's header.

=item B<-entries>

Outputs every entry in the database. Some of the information is similar to
that returned by the B<pts examine> command.

=item B<-verbose>

Reports additional information about the database, including the number of
entries in the database and a trace of the internal database structures
the command is verifying.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If there are errors in the database, the output always reports them on the
standard error stream. If any options other than B<-database> or B<-help>
are provided, the output written to the standard output stream includes
additional information as described for each option in L</OPTIONS>.  The
output is intended for debugging purposes and is meaningful to someone
familiar with the internal structure of the Protection Database.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the local superuser C<root>.
