=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bos getrestart command displays two restart times from the
F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file on the server machine named by the
B<-server> argument:

=over 4

=item *

The I<general restart> time at which the BOS Server process automatically
restarts itself and all processes marked with status C<Run> in the
F<BosConfig> file. The default is Sunday at 4:00 a.m.

=item *

The I<binary restart> time at which the BOS Server automatically restarts
any process for which the time stamp on the binary file in the
F</usr/afs/bin> directory is later than the last restart time for the
process. The default is 5:00 a.m. Use the B<bos getdate> command to list a
binary file's timestamp, and the B<-long> flag to the B<bos status>
command to display a process's most recent restart time.

=back

Use the B<bos setrestart> command to set the restart times.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine for which to display the restart
times. Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either
fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The output consists of two lines:

   Server <machine_name> restarts at <time>
   Server <machine_name> restarts for new binaries at <time>

Possible values for <time> include:

=over 4

=item *

C<never>, indicating that the BOS Server never performs that type of
restart.

=item *

C<now>, indicating that the BOS Server performs that type of restart only
each time it restarts.

=item *

A specified day and time, indicating that the BOS Server performs that
type of restart once per week. Example: C<sun 4:00 am>.

=item *

A specified time, indicating that the BOS Server performs that type of
restart once per day. Examples: C<11:00 pm>, C<3:00 am>.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example displays the restart times for the machine
C<db2.example.com>:

   % bos getrestart db2.example.com
   Server db2.example.com restarts at sun 4:00 am
   Server db2.example.com restarts for new binaries at 2:15 am

In the following example, the issuer abbreviates the machine name
C<fs1.example.com> to C<fs1>, relying on the cell's name server to resolve the
name. The output echoes the abbreviated form.

   % bos getrestart fs1
   Server fs1 restarts at sat 5:00 am
   Server fs1 restarts for new binaries at 11:30 pm
