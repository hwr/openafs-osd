=head1 NAME

kas - Introduction to the kas command suite

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The commands in the B<kas> command suite are the administrative interface
to the Authentication Server, an obsolete AFS server process that
maintains the Authentication Database and provides the authentication
tickets that client applications must present to AFS servers in order to
obtain access to AFS data and other services. It is used only for cells
still running the Authentication Server until they can migrate to a
Kerberos version 5 KDC.

There are several categories of commands in the B<kas> command suite:

=over 4

=item *

Commands to create, modify, examine and delete entries in the
Authentication Database, including passwords:
L<B<kas create>|kas_create(8)>,
L<B<kas delete>|kas_delete(8)>,
L<B<kas examine>|kas_examine(8)>,
L<B<kas list>|kas_list(8)>,
L<B<kas setfields>|kas_setfields(8)>,
L<B<kas setkey>|kas_setkey(8)>,
L<B<kas setpassword>|kas_setpassword(8)>,
and L<B<kas unlock>|kas_unlock(8)>.

=item *

Commands to create, delete, and examine tokens and server tickets:
L<B<kas forgetticket>|kas_forgetticket(8)>,
L<B<kas listtickets>|kas_listtickets(8)>,
L<B<kas noauthentication>|kas_noauthentication(8)>,
and L<B<kas stringtokey>|kas_stringtokey(8)>.

=item *

A command to enter interactive mode:
L<B<kas interactive>|kas_interactive(8)>.

=item *

A command to trace Authentication Server operations:
L<B<kas statistics>|kas_statistics(8)>.

=item *

Commands to obtain help:
L<B<kas apropos>|kas_apropos(8)>
and L<B<kas help>|kas_help(8)>.

=item *

A command to display the OpenAFS command suite version: B<kas version>.

=back

Because of the sensitivity of information in the Authentication Database,
the Authentication Server authenticates issuers of B<kas> commands
directly, rather than accepting the standard token generated by the Ticket
Granting Service. Any B<kas> command that requires administrative
privilege prompts the issuer for a password. The resulting ticket is valid
for six hours unless the maximum ticket lifetime for the issuer or the
Authentication Server's Ticket Granting Service is shorter.

To avoid having to provide a password repeatedly when issuing a sequence
of B<kas> commands, enter I<interactive mode> by issuing the B<kas
interactive> command, typing B<kas> without any operation code, or typing
B<kas> followed by a user and cell name, separated by an at-sign (C<@>; an
example is C<kas smith.admin@example.com>). After prompting once for a
password, the Authentication Server accepts the resulting token for every
command issued during the interactive session. See L<kas_interactive(8)>
for a discussion of when to use each method for entering interactive mode
and of the effects of entering a session.

The Authentication Server maintains two databases on the local disk of the
machine where it runs:

=over 4

=item *

The Authentication Database (F</usr/afs/db/kaserver.DB0>) stores the
information used to provide AFS authentication services to users and
servers, including the password scrambled as an encryption key. The
reference page for the B<kas examine> command describes the information in
a database entry.

=item *

An auxiliary file (F</usr/afs/local/kaauxdb> by default) that tracks how
often the user has provided an incorrect password to the local
Authentication Server. The reference page for the B<kas setfields> command
describes how the Authentication Server uses this file to enforce the
limit on consecutive authentication failures. To designate an alternate
directory for the file, use the B<kaserver> command's B<-localfiles>
argument.

=back

=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<kas> command suite is provided only for administration of the
obsolete Authentication Server for cells that have not yet migrated to a
Kerberos version 5 KDC. New deployments should not use the Authentication
Server, and it and the B<kas> command suite will be removed in a future
version of OpenAFS.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following arguments and flags are available on many commands in the
B<kas> suite. (Some of them are unavailable on commands entered in
interactive mode, because the information they specify is established when
entering interactive mode and cannot be changed except by leaving
interactive mode.) The reference page for each command also lists them,
but they are described here in greater detail.

=over 4

=item B<-admin_username> <I<user name>>

Specifies the user identity under which to authenticate with the
Authentication Server for execution of the command. If this argument is
omitted, the B<kas> command interpreter requests authentication for the
identity under which the issuer is logged onto the local machine.  Do not
combine this argument with the B<-noauth> flag.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. It is acceptable to abbreviate
the cell name to the shortest form that distinguishes it from the other
entries in the F</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file on the local machine. If
the B<-cell> argument is omitted, the command interpreter determines the
name of the local cell by reading the following in order:

=over 4

=item *

The value of the AFSCELL environment variable.

=item *

The local F</usr/vice/etc/ThisCell> file.

=back

The B<-cell> argument is not available on commands issued in interactive
mode. The cell defined when the B<kas> command interpreter enters
interactive mode applies to all commands issued during the interactive
session.

=item B<-help>

Prints a command's online help message on the standard output stream. Do
not combine this flag with any of the command's other options; when it is
provided, the command interpreter ignores all other options, and only
prints the help message.

=item B<-noauth>

Establishes an unauthenticated connection to the Authentication Server, in
which the Authentication Server treats the issuer as the unprivileged user
C<anonymous>. It is useful only when authorization checking is disabled on
the server machine (during the installation of a server machine or when
the B<bos setauth> command has been used during other unusual
circumstances). In normal circumstances, the Authentication Server allows
only privileged users to issue most B<kas> commands, and refuses to
perform such an action even if the B<-noauth> flag is provided. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-admin_username> and B<-password_for_admin>
arguments.

=item B<-password_for_admin> <I<password>>

Specifies the password of the command's issuer. It is best to omit this
argument, which echoes the password visibly in the command shell, instead
enter the password at the prompt. Do not combine this argument with the
B<-noauth> flag.

=item B<-servers> <I<machine name>>+

Establishes a connection with the Authentication Server running on each
specified database server machine, instead of on each machine listed in
the local F</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file. In either case, the B<kas>
command interpreter then chooses one of the machines at random to contact
for execution of each subsequent command. The issuer can abbreviate the
machine name to the shortest form that allows the local name service to
identify it uniquely.

=back

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

To issue most kas commands, the issuer must have the C<ADMIN> flag set in
his or her Authentication Database entry (use the B<kas setfields> command
to turn the flag on).
