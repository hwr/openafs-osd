=head1 NAME

kas_listtickets - Displays all of the issuer's tickets (tokens)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<kas listtickets> S<<< [B<-name> <I<name of server>>] >>> [B<-long>] [B<-help>]

B<kas listt> S<<< [B<-n> <I<name of server>>] >>> [B<-l>] [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<kas listtickets> command displays the associated user ID (AFS UID),
cell name, and expiration date of some or all of the issuer's tickets
(tokens), depending on which options are provided:

=over 4

=item *

To display all tokens, provide neither the B<-name> argument nor B<-long>
flag. The output is similar to that of the B<tokens> command.

=item *

To display a single token, provide the B<-name> argument to specify name
of the Authentication Database entry for the entity that accepts the
token. All AFS server processes accept tokens sealed with the key from the
C<afs> entry.

=item *

To display in addition the octal numbers that constitute the token and
session key, provide the B<-long> flag.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-name> <I<name of server>>

Names the Authentication Database entry of the entity (usually a server
process) that accepts the token to display.

=item B<-long>

Displays the octal numbers that constitute the session key and ticket.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The output reports the AFS UID of the user who owns the token, the service
(usually, C<afs>) and cell for which it is valid, and its expiration date,
using the following format. If the message does not specify a cell, the
ticket is for the local cell.

   User's (AFS ID <AFS UID>) tokens for <service>[@<cellname>] \
       [Expires <date>]

If the B<-long> flag is provided, the output also includes the octal
numbers making up the session key and token, along with the key version
number and the number of bytes in the token (if the number of bytes is not
56, there is an error).

If the marker C<<< [>> POSTDATED <] >>> appears instead of an expiration
date, the ticket does not become valid until the indicated time. (Only
internal calls can create a postdated ticket; there is no standard
interface that allows users to do this.)

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following two examples are for a user with AFS UID 1020 in the
C<example.com> cell and AFS UID 35 in the C<test.example.com> cell. He is working
on a machine in the first cell and is authenticated in both cells.

   % kas listtickets
   User's (AFS ID 1020) tokens for afs [Expires Wed Mar 31 9:30:54 1999]
   User's (AFS ID 35@test.example.com) tokens for afs@test.example.com \
             [Expires Wed Mar 31 13:54:26 1999]

   % kas listtickets -name afs -long
   User's (AFS ID 1020) tokens for afs [Expires Wed Mar 31 9:30:54 1999]
   SessionKey: \375\205\351\227\032\310\263\013
   Ticket: (kvno = 0, len = 56): \033\005\221\156\203\278\312\058\016\133...
