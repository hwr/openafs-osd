=head1 NAME

backup_listhosts - Lists Tape Coordinators registered in the Backup Database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<backup listhosts> [B<-localauth>] S<<< [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>] >>> [B<-help>]

B<backup listh> [B<-l>] S<<< [B<-c> <I<cell name>>] >>> [B<-h>]

</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup listhosts> command displays the Backup Database record of the
port offset numbers defined for Tape Coordinator machines. A Tape
Coordinator must have an entry in the list to be available for backup
operations.

The existence of an entry does not necessarily indicate that the Tape
Coordinator process (B<butc>) is currently running at that port offset. To
check, issue the B<backup status> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

After a C<Tape hosts:> header, the output reports two things about each
Tape Coordinator currently defined in the Backup Database:

=over 4

=item *

The hostname of the machine housing the Tape Coordinator. The format of
this name depends on the hostname format used when the B<backup addhost>
command was issued.

=item *

The Tape Coordinator's port offset number.

=back

The Tape Coordinators appear in the order in which they were added to the
Backup Database.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows the result of the command in the Example
Corporation cell:

   % backup listhosts
   Tape hosts:
       Host backup1.example.com, port offset 0
       Host backup1.example.com, port offset 1
       Host backup3.example.com, port offset 4
       Host backup2.example.com, port offset 3

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on every
machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
