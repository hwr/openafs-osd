=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos start> command sets the status flag for each process specified
by the B<-instance> argument to C<Run> in the F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig>
file and in the BOS Server's memory on the server machine named by the
B<-server> argument, then starts it. If the process is already running,
the command's only effect is to guarantee that the status flag is C<Run>;
it does not restart the process.

To start a process without changing its status flag in the F<BosConfig>
file, use the B<bos startup> command instead.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to start processes. Identify the
machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-instance> <I<server process name>>+

Names each process to start. Use the process name assigned with the
B<-instance> argument to the B<bos create> command. The output from the
B<bos status> command lists the names.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command changes the status flag for the C<upclientbin> and
C<upclientetc> processes to C<Run> in the F<BosConfig> file on the machine
C<fs6.example.com> and starts them running.

   % bos start -server fs6.example.com -instance upclientbin upclientetc

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
