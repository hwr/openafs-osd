=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup kill> command dequeues a Backup System operation that is
pending, or terminates an operation that is running, in the current
interactive session. It is available only in interactive mode.  If the
issuer of the B<backup interactive> command included the B<-localauth>
flag, the B<-cell> argument, or both, then those settings apply to this
command also.

To terminate a dump operation, specify either the dump name
(I<volume_set_name>.I<dump_level_name>) or its job ID number, which
appears in the output from the B<backup jobs> command. To terminate any
other type of operation, provide the job ID number.

The effect of terminating an operation depends on the type and current
state of the operation:

=over 4

=item *

If an operation is still pending, the Tape Coordinator removes it from the
queue with no other lasting effects.

=item *

If the Tape Coordinator is unable to process the termination signal before
an operation completes, it simply confirms the operation's completion. The
operator must take the action necessary to undo the effects of the
incorrect operation.

=item *

If a tape labeling operation is running, the effect depends on when the
Tape Coordinator receives the termination signal. The labeling operation
is atomic, so it either completes or does not begin at all.  Use the
B<backup readlabel> command to determine if the labeling operation
completed, and reissue the B<backup labeltape> command to overwrite the
incorrect label if necessary.

=item *

If a tape scanning operation is running, it terminates with no other
effects unless the B<-dbadd> flag was included on the B<backup>
command. In that case, the Backup System possibly has already written new
Backup Database records to represent dumps on the scanned tape. If
planning to restart the scanning operation, first locate and remove the
records created during the terminated operation: a repeated B<backup
scantape> operation exits automatically when it finds that a record that
it needs to create already exists.

=item *

If a dump operation is running, all of the volumes written to the tape or
backup data file before the termination signal is received are complete
and usable. If the operation is restarted, the Backup System performs all
the dumps again from scratch, and assigns a new dump ID number. If writing
the new dumps to the same tape or file, the operator must relabel it first
if the interrupted dump is not expired. If writing the new dump to a
different tape or file, the operator can remove the dump record associated
with the interrupted dump to free up space in the database.

=item *

If a restore operation is running, completely restored volumes are online
and usable. However, it is unlikely that many volumes are completely
restored, given that complete restoration usually requires data from
multiple tapes. If the termination signal comes before the Backup System
has accessed all of the necessary tapes, each volume is only partially
written and is never brought online. It is best to restart the restore
operation from scratch to avoid possible inconsistencies. See also
L</CAUTIONS>.

=back

=head1 CAUTIONS

It is best not to issue the B<backup kill> command against restore
operations. If the termination signal interrupts a restore operation as
the Backup System is overwriting an existing volume, it is possible to
lose the volume entirely (that is, to lose both the contents of the volume
as it was before the restore and any data that was restored before the
termination signal arrived). The data being restored still exists on the
tape, but some data can be lost permanently.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-id> <I<job ID or dump set name>>

Identifies the backup operation to terminate. Provide one of two types of
values:

=over 4

=item *

The operation's job ID number, as displayed in the output of the B<backup
jobs> command.

=item *

For a dump operation, either the job ID number or a dump name of the form
I<volume_set_name>.I<dump_level_name>, where I<volume_set_name> is the
name of the volume set being dumped and I<dump_level_name> is the last
element in the dump level pathname at which the volume set is being
dumped. The dump name appears in the output of the B<backup jobs> command
along with the job ID number.

=back

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command terminates the operation with job ID 5:

   backup> kill 5

The following command terminates the dump operation called
C<user.sunday1>:

   backup> kill user.sunday1

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the privilege required to initiate the operation
being cancelled. Because this command can be issued only within the
interactive session during which the operation was initiated, the required
privilege is essentially guaranteed.
