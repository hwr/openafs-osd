=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos listhosts> command formats and displays the list of a cell's
database server machines from the F</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file on the
server machine named by the B<-server> argument.

To alter the list of machines, use the B<bos addhost> and B<bos
removehost> commands.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine from which to display the
F</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file. Identify the machine by IP address or its
host name (either fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For
details, see L<bos(8)>.

For consistent performance in the cell, the output must be the same on
every server machine. The B<bos addhost> reference page explains how to
keep the machines synchronized.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The first line of the output names the cell to which the server machine
belongs. Each of the following lines names a database server machine for
that cell.

The C<Host> number assigned to each database server machine is for
server-internal use only and is not the same as, nor necessarily related
to, the machine's IP address. The BOS Server assigned it as part of
performing the B<bos addhost> command.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command displays the database server machines listed in the
F</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file on the machine C<fs7.example.com>.

   % bos listhosts fs7.example.com
   Cell name is example.com
       Host 1 is db1.example.com
       Host 2 is db2.example.com
       Host 3 is db3.example.com
