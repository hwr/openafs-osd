=item B<-d> <I<debug level>>

Sets the detail level for the debugging trace written to the
F</usr/afs/logs/VolserLog> file. Provide one of the following values, each
of which produces an increasingly detailed trace: C<0>, C<1>, C<5>, C<25>,
and C<125>. 

=item B<-log>

Records in the /usr/afs/logs/VolserLog file the names of all users who
successfully initiate a B<vos> command. The Volume Server also records any
file removals that result from issuing the B<vos release> command with the
B<-f> flag.

=item B<-p> <I<number of processes>>

Sets the number of server lightweight processes (LWPs) to run.  Provide an
integer between C<4> and C<16>. The default is C<9>.

=item B<-auditlog> <I<log path>>

Turns on audit logging, and sets the path for the audit log.  The audit
log records information about RPC calls, including the name of the RPC
call, the host that submitted the call, the authenticated entity (user)
that issued the call, the parameters for the call, and if the call
succeeded or failed.

=item B<-audit-interface> (file | sysvmq)

Specifies what audit interface to use. Defaults to C<file>. See
L<fileserver(8)> for an explanation of each interface.

=item B<-udpsize> <I<size of socket buffer>>

Sets the size of the UDP buffer in bytes, which is 64 KB by
default. Provide a positive integer, preferably larger than the default.

=item B<-jumbo>

Allows the server to send and receive jumbograms. A jumbogram is
a large-size packet composed of 2 to 4 normal Rx data packets that share
the same header. The volserver does not use jumbograms by default, as some
routers are not capable of properly breaking the jumbogram into smaller
packets and reassembling them.

=item B<-nojumbo>

Deprecated; jumbograms are disabled by default.

=item B<-enable_peer_stats>

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. For each connection with a specific UDP port on another machine,
a separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile, GetStatus, and
so on) sent or received. To display or otherwise access the records, use
the Rx Monitoring API.

=item B<-enable_process_stats>

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. A separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile,
GetStatus, and so on) sent or received, aggregated over all connections to
other machines. To display or otherwise access the records, use the Rx
Monitoring API.

=item B<-allow-dotted-principals>

By default, the RXKAD security layer will disallow access by Kerberos
principals with a dot in the first component of their name. This is to avoid
the confusion where principals user/admin and user.admin are both mapped to the
user.admin PTS entry. Sites whose Kerberos realms don't have these collisions 
between principal names may disable this check by starting the server
with this option.

=item B<-preserve-vol-stats>

Preserve volume access statistics over volume restore and reclone operations.
By default, volume access statistics are reset during volume restore and reclone
operations.

=item B<-sync> <I<sync behavior>>

This is the same as the B<-sync> option in L<fileserver(8)>. See
L<fileserver(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
