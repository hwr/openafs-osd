=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos delete> command removes the F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> entry
for each process indicated by the B<-instance> argument, on the server
machine named by the B<-server> argument.

Before issuing this command, issue the bos stop command to stop the
process and set its status flag in the F<BosConfig> file to C<NotRun>. The
B<bos delete> command fails with an error message if a process's status
flag is C<Run>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to delete the server process entry
from the F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file. Identify the machine
by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or abbreviated
unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-instance> <I<server process name>>+

Names each process to delete. Use the name assigned with the B<-instance>
argument to the B<bos create> command; process names appear in the output
of the B<bos status> command.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

       -instance buserver kaserver ptserver vlserver

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
