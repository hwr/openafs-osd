=head1 NAME

uss - Introduction to the uss command suite (deprecated)

=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<uss> command suite is currently designed for cells using the
obsolete Authentication Server, and therefore is primarily useful for
sites that have not yet migrated to a Kerberos version 5 KDC. The
Authentication Server and supporting commands will be removed in a future
version of OpenAFS, which may include B<uss> unless someone who finds it
useful converts it to work with a Kerberos version 5 KDC.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The commands in the B<uss> command suite help administrators to create AFS
user accounts more easily and efficiently for cells using the obsolete
Authentication Server. If B<uss> commands are not used, creating an
account requires issuing at least six separate commands to five different
AFS servers.

There are three main commands in the suite:

=over 4

=item *

The B<uss add> command creates a single complete user account, based on
command line arguments and instructions in a template file.

=item *

The B<uss bulk> command creates multiple complete accounts at once, based
on command line arguments, instructions in a template file and a bulk
input file.

=item *

The B<uss delete> command removes most parts of a user account.

=back

To obtain help, issue the B<uss apropos> and B<uss help> commands.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following arguments and flags are available on many commands in the
B<uss> suite. The reference page for each command also lists them, but
they are described here in greater detail.

=over 4

=item B<-admin> <I<administrator to authenticate>>

Specifies the AFS user name under which to establish a connection to the
AFS server processes that administer the various parts of a user
account. If it is omitted, the connection is established under the
issuer's effective user ID (his or her identity in the local file
system). Even when this argument is included, UNIX commands that run
during the B<uss> operation (for instance, the UNIX F</etc/chown> command)
run under the effective user ID.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. It is acceptable to abbreviate
the cell name to the shortest form that distinguishes it from the other
entries in the F</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file on the local machine. If
the B<-cell> argument is omitted, the command interpreter determines the
name of the local cell by reading the following in order:

=over 4

=item *

The value of the AFSCELL environment variable.

=item *

The local F</usr/vice/etc/ThisCell> file.

=back

=item B<-dryrun>

Reports actions that the command interpreter needs to perform when
executing the B<uss> operation, without actually performing them. Include
this flag to verify that the command produces the desired account
configuration. Combine it with the B<-verbose> flag to yield even more
detailed information. Note that the output does not necessarily reveal all
possible problems that can prevent successful execution of the command,
especially those that result from transient server or network outages.

=item B<-help>

Prints a command's online help message on the standard output stream. Do
not combine this flag with any of the command's other options; when it is
provided, the command interpreter ignores all other options, and only
prints the help message.

=item B<-skipauth>

Bypasses mutual authentication with the AFS Authentication Server, allowing
a site that uses Kerberos instead of the AFS Authentication Server to
substitute that form of authentication. If this option is given, B<uss> does
not create or manipulate Kerberos principals. A Kerberos principal must be
created separately from the B<uss add> command.

=back

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer of a B<uss> command must have all the rights required for
performing the equivalent actions individually. See each B<uss> command's
reference page.
