=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos prune> command removes files from the local disk of the server
machine named by the B<-server> argument, as specified by one or more of
the following flags provided on the command line:

=over 4

=item *

The B<-bak> flag removes all files from the F</usr/afs/bin> directory that
have a C<.BAK> extension.

=item *

The B<-old> flag removes all files from the F</usr/afs/bin> directory that
have a C<.OLD> extension.

=item *

The B<-core> flag removes all files from the F</usr/afs/logs> directory
that have a C<core.> prefix.

=item *

The B<-all> flag removes all three types of files at once.

=back

(If none of these flags are included, the command appears to succeed, but
removes no files at all.)

To display the timestamp on the current, C<.BAK>, and C<.OLD> versions of
one or more files, use the B<bos getdate> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine from which to remove files. Identify the
machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-bak>

Removes all files from the F</usr/afs/bin> directory that have a C<.BAK>
extension. Do not combine this flag and the B<-all> flag.

=item B<-old>

Removes all files from the F</usr/afs/bin> directory that have a C<.OLD>
extension. Do not combine this flag and the B<-all> flag.

=item B<-core>

Removes all files from the F</usr/afs/logs> directory that have a C<core.>
prefix. Do not combine this flag and the B<-all> flag.

=item B<-all>

Combines the effect of the B<-bak>, B<-old>, and B<-core> flags. Do not
combine this flag with any of those three.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example removes all files from the F</usr/afs/bin> directory
on the machine C<fs3.example.com> that have a C<.BAK> or C<.OLD> extension.

   % bos prune -server fs3.example.com -bak -old

The following example removes all files from the F</usr/afs/bin> directory
on the machine C<db2.example.com> that have a C<.BAK> or C<.OLD> extension,
and all files from the F</usr/afs/logs> directory that have a C<core.>
prefix.

   % bos prune -server db2.example.com -all

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.

The B<bos prune> command cannot be run against servers which are in
restricted mode.
