=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pt_util> command can be used to load or dump the protection
database.  It should only be used when B<ptserver> is not running.

The most likely reason to use it is to initialize the protection database
when bringing up a new cell.  The current syntax for this, presented
below, needs improvement.  B<pt_util> can also be used when problems are
suspected with the database.  It can be used to dump the database or
portions thereof, in several different ways, and to reload it.

The textual representation of the database has the following form:
For users,

    name flags/quota viceid ownerid creatorid

For groups,

    name flags/quota viceid ownerid creatorid
     a-username a-user-viceid

The second line is repeated for each member of the group.  When reading
the database, membership is not reported unless B<-members> is also
included.

=head1 OPTIONS

If you don't specify any options, the only thing you'll learn is the ubik
database epoch and version.

=over 4

=item B<-w>

Write to the protection database instead of reading.  Only the file
arguments make sense in combination with this argument.

=item B<-user>

When reading, display users.

=item B<-group>

When reading, display groups (but not necessarily members).

=item B<-members>

When reading, display groups and also group members.

=item B<-name>

When reading,
follow name hashes, instead of id hashes.
This may print different information if the database was corrupted.
Otherwise, it should print exactly the same information, except
in a different order.

=item B<-system>

When reading, display system data, or more precisely, do not display
entries with a viced <= -32768 or >= +97537.

=item B<-xtra>

When reading, display extra users and groups, or more precisely, do not
display entries that are in the range -32767...+97536 inclusive.

=item B<-prdb> <I<prdb file>>

Specifies the complete pathname of the file in which the Protection
Database resides.  Provide the complete name, including the ending
F<.DB0>.

=item B<-datafile> <I<data file>>

Specify the file to which to dump (or B<-w> from which to read) textual
database records.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

=back

=head1 CAUTIONS

Entry timestamps and other information is not preserved when dumping the
protection database.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows how to initialize the database from scratch.

Before you do this, make sure B<ptserver> is not running.  If you have
multiple database servers, make sure F<prdb.*> does not exist on any
server machine.

Now, type this in EXACTLY, including the leading space on the line
indicated.  But do use Control-D at the end, not up-arrow D.

    pt_util -w
    admin 128/20 1 -204 -204
    system:administrators 130/20 -204 -204 -204
     admin 1
    ^D

You will see this:

    # pt_util -w
    pt_util: /usr/afs/db/prdb.DB0: Bad UBIK_MAGIC. Is 0 should be 354545
    Ubik Version is: 2.0
    admin 128/20 1 -204 -204
    system:administrators 130/20 -204 -204 -204
    Error while creating system:administrators: Entry for id already exists
     admin 1
    pt_util: Ubik Version number changed during execution.
    Old Version = 2.0, new version = 33554432.0
    #

To make a complete copy of the database,

    # pt_util -user -members -datafile /tmp/out

To load from the complete copy,

    # pt_util -w -datafile /tmp/out

Don't do this until you read cautions, above.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the superuser C<root> on a database server
machine to use B<pt_util>.
