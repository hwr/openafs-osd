=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos restart> command stops and immediately restarts server processes
on the server machine named by the B<-server> argument. Indicate which
process or processes to restart by providing one of the following
arguments:

=over 4

=item *

The B<-instance> argument names each AFS server process to stop and
restart immediately, regardless of its status flag in the
F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file. Do not include B<bosserver> in the list
of processes; use the B<-bosserver> flag instead.

=item *

The B<-bosserver> flag stops all AFS server processes running on the
machine, including the BOS Server. A new BOS Server starts immediately,
and it starts a new instance of each process that is marked with the
C<Run> status flag in the F<BosConfig> file.

=item *

The B<-all> flag stops all AFS server processes running on the machine,
except the BOS Server, and immediately restarts the processes that are
marked with the C<Run> status flag in the F<BosConfig> file.

=back

This command does not change a process's status flag in the F<BosConfig>
file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to restart each process.  Identify
the machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-instance> <I<instances>>+

Names each process to stop and then restart immediately regardless of its
status flag setting. Use the process name assigned with the B<-instance>
argument to the B<bos create> command. The output from the B<bos status>
command lists the names. Provide this flag or one of the B<-bosserver> or
B<-all> options, but do not combine them.

=item B<-bosserver>

Stops all AFS server processes running on the machine, including the BOS
Server. A new BOS Server instance immediately starts, and starts all
processes marked with the C<Run> status flag in the F<BosConfig>
file. Provide this flag or one of the B<-instance> or B<-all> options, but
do not combine them.

=item B<-all>

Stops all AFS server processes running on the machine other than the BOS
Server, and immediately restarts the processes marked with the B<Run>
status flag in the F<BosConfig> file. Provide this flag or one of the
B<-instance> or B<-bosserver> options, but do not combine them.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command stops and restarts all processes running on the
machine C<fs3.example.com>, including the BOS Server.

   % bos restart -server fs3.example.com -bosserver

The following command stops and restarts all processes running on the
machine C<fs5.example.com>, excluding the BOS Server.

   % bos restart -server fs5.example.com -all

The following command stops and restarts the Protection Server and Volume
Location (VL) Server processes on the machine C<db3.example.com>:

   % bos restart -server db3.example.com -instance ptserver vlserver

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
