=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<kdb> S<<< [B<-dbmfile> <I<dbmfile to use (default /usr/afs/logs/AuthLog)>>] >>>
    S<<< [B<-key> <I<extract entries that match specified key>>] >>>
    [B<-long>] [B<-numeric>] [B<-help>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<kdb> command displays the contents of the F<AuthLog.dir> and
F<AuthLog.pag> files associated with the F<AuthLog> file that resides on
the local disk, by default in the F</usr/afs/logs> directory. The files
must exist in that directory, which normally implies that the
Authentication Server is running on the machine. The files contain
information on privileged actions performed by the obsolete Authentication
Server.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The B<kdb> command is only used to read the log files from the obsolete
Authentication Server, which should no longer be used. It is provided for
sites that have not yet migrated to a Kerberos version 5 KDC. The
Authentication Server and supporting commands, including B<kdb>, will be
removed in a future version of OpenAFS.

It is possible that on some operating systems that AFS otherwise supports,
the Authentication Server cannot create the F</usr/afs/logs/AuthLog.dir>
and F</usr/afs/logs/AuthLog.pag> files, making this command inoperative.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-dbmfile> <I<dbmfile to use>>

Specifies the pathname of the file to display. Provide either a complete
pathname, a pathname relative to the F</usr/afs/logs> directory, or a
filename only, in which case the file must reside in the F</usr/afs/logs>
directory. Omit this argument to display information from the
F<AuthLog.dir> and F<AuthLog.pag> files in the F</usr/afs/logs> directory.

=item B<-key> <I<extract entries that match specified key>>

Specifies each entry to be displayed from the indicated file.

=item B<-long>

When printing all entries, print out detailed information for each entry.

=item B<-numeric>

Do not resolve IP addresses to hostnames, and instead print out numeric IP
addresses.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 OUTPUT

The first line of output indicates the location of the files from which
the subsequent information is derived:

Each entry then includes the following two fields, separated by a colon:
