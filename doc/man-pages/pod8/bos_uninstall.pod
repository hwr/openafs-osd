=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos uninstall> command replaces each binary file specified by the
B<-file> argument with its C<.BAK> version on the server machine named by
the B<-server> argument, which is normally the binary distribution machine
for its CPU/operating system type. It also changes the extension on the
current C<.OLD> version (if any) to C<.BAK>. Each binary file must reside
in the local F</usr/afs/bin> directory unless the B<-dir> argument names
an alternate directory.

To start using the reverted binary immediately, issue the B<bos restart>
command. Otherwise, the BOS Server automatically restarts the process at
the time defined in the F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file; use the B<bos
getrestart> command to display the time and the B<bos setrestart> time to
set it.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the binary distribution machine on which to revert to the
C<.BAK> version of binaries. Identify the machine by IP address or its
host name (either fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For
details, see L<bos(8)>.

If the machine is not a binary distribution machine and is running an
C<upclientbin> process, then the files are overwritten the next time the
C<upclientbin> process fetches the corresponding file from the
distribution machine (by default within five minutes).

=item B<-file> <I<files to uninstall>>+

Names each binary file to replace with its C<.BAK> version.

=item B<-dir> <I<destinatino dir>>

Provides the complete pathname of the local disk directory containing each
file named by the B<-file> argument. It is necessary only if the binaries
are not in the F</usr/afs/bin> directory.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example command overwrites the F</usr/afs/bin/kaserver> file
on the machine C<fs4.example.com> with its C<.BAK> version, and the current
C<.BAK> version by the C<.OLD> version.

   % bos uninstall -server fs4.example.com -file kaserver

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.

The B<bos uninstall> command cannot be run against servers running in
restricted mode.
