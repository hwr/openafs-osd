=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos exec> command executes the indicated command on the file server
machine named by the B<-server> argument. Its intended use is to reboot
the machine, using the F</sbin/reboot> command or equivalent.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to execute the command.  Identify
the machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-cmd> <I<command to execute>>

Specifies the complete local disk pathname of the command to execute (for
example, F</sbin/reboot>). Surround this argument with double quotes
(C<"">) if the command contains one or more spaces.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command reboots the machine C<fs2.example.com>. The issuer has
previously issued the B<bos shutdown> command to shutdown all processes
cleanly.

   % bos exec -server fs2.example.com -cmd /sbin/shutdown -r now

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.

The B<bos exec> command is not available on servers running in restricted
mode.
