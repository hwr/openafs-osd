=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<dafileserver> command initializes the File Server component of the
C<dafs> process. In the conventional configuration, its binary file is
located in the F</usr/afs/bin> directory on a file server machine.

The B<dafileserver> command is not normally issued at the command shell
prompt, but rather placed into a database server machine's
F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file with the B<bos create> command. If it is
ever issued at the command shell prompt, the issuer must be logged onto a
file server machine as the local superuser C<root>.

=head1 CAUTIONS

=include fragments/fileserver-cautions.pod

=head1 OPTIONS

=include fragments/fileserver-options.pod

=item B<-fs-state-dont-save>

When present, fileserver state will not be saved during shutdown.  Default
is to save state.

=item B<-fs-state-dont-restore>

When present, fileserver state will not be restored during startup.
Default is to restore state on startup.

=item B<-fs-state-verify> (none | save | restore | both)

This argument controls the behavior of the state verification mechanism.
A value of C<none> turns off all verification.  A value of C<save> only
performs the verification steps prior to saving state to disk.  A value
of C<restore> only performs the verification steps after restoring state
from disk.  A value of C<both> performs all verifications steps both
prior to save and following a restore.

The default is C<both>.

=item B<-vlrudisable>

This option completely disables the VLRU mechanism, which means volumes will
never "soft detach". The use of this option is only intended for debugging use
or if you find a serious bug in the VLRU mechanism you wish to work around.

=item B<-vlruthresh <I<minutes>>

The number of minutes of inactivity before a volume is eligible for soft
detachment.  Default is 120 minutes.

=item B<-vlruinterval <I<seconds>>

The number of seconds between VLRU candidate queue scan.  The default is
120 seconds.

=item B<-vlrumax <I<positive integer>>

The maximum number of volumes which can be soft detached in a single pass
of the scanner.  Default is 8 volumes.

=item B<-unsafe-nosalvage>

This option causes the fileserver to bypass the normal safety check when
attaching volumes that checks the inUse field in the volume header. With
this option, volumes that were in use at the time of an unclean shutdown
will not be salvaged immediately the next time they are accessed, and thus
risk (possibly silent and/or irrevocable) corruption. Volumes will still
be salvaged when an internal inconsistency is detected or other cases
where a salvage would normally occur.

Due to the increased risk of data corruption, the use of this flag is
strongly discouraged. Only use it if you really know what you are doing.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following B<bos create> command creates a dafs process on
the file server machine C<fs2.example.com> that uses the large configuration
size, and allows volumes to exceed their quota by 10%. Type the command on
a single line:

   % bos create -server fs2.example.com -instance dafs -type dafs \
                -cmd "/usr/afs/bin/dafileserver -pctspare 10 -L" \
                /usr/afs/bin/davolserver \
                /usr/afs/bin/salvageserver \
                /usr/afs/bin/dasalvager
