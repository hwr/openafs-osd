backup_dbverify - Checks the integrity of the Backup Database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for html
<div class="synopsis">

B<backup dbverify> [B<-detail>] [B<-localauth>]
    S<<< [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>] >>>
    [B<-help>]

B<backup db> [B<-d>] [B<-l>] S<<< [B<-c> <I<cell name>>] >>> [B<-h>]

=for html
</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup dbverify> command checks the integrity of the Backup
Database. The command's output indicates whether the Backup Database is
damaged (data is corrupted) or not. If the Backup Database is undamaged,
it is safe to continue using it. If it is corrupted, discontinue any
backup operations until it is repaired.

=head1 CAUTIONS

While this command runs, no other backup operation can access the Backup
Database; the other commands do not run until this command
completes. Avoid issuing this command when other backup operations are
likely to run. The B<backup savedb> command repairs some types of
corruption.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-detail>

Reports the number of orphaned blocks found, any inconsistencies, and the
name of the server machine running the Backup Server that is checking its
copy of the database.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The command displays one of the following two messages:

=over 4

=item Database OK

The database is undamaged and can be used.

=item Database not OK

The database is damaged. You can use the backup savedb command to repair
many kinds of corruption as it creates a backup copy.  For more detailed
instructions, see the I<OpenAFS Administration Guide> chapter about
performing backup operations.

=back

The B<-detail> flag provides additional information:

=over 4

=item *

The number of I<orphan blocks> found. These are ranges of memory that the
Backup Server preallocated in the database but cannot use. Orphan blocks
do not interfere with database access, but do waste disk space. To free
the unusable space, dump the database to tape by using the B<backup
savedb> command, and then restore it by using the B<backup restoredb>
command.

=item *

Any inconsistencies in the database, such as invalid hostnames for Tape
Coordinator machines.

=item *

The name of the database server machine on which the Backup Database was
checked, designated as the C<Database checker>. For a detailed trace of
the verification operation, see the F</usr/afs/logs/BackupLog> file on the
indicated machine. You can use the B<bos getlog> command to display it.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command confirms that the Backup Database is undamaged:

   % backup dbverify
   Database OK

The following command confirms that the Backup Database is undamaged and
that it has no orphan blocks or invalid Tape Coordinator entries. The
Backup Server running on the machine C<db1.example.com> checked its copy of
the Database.

   % backup dbverify -detail
   Database OK
   Orphan blocks 0
   Database checker was db1.example.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on every
machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
