=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos setauth> command enables or disables authorization checking on
the server machine named by the B<-server> argument. When authorization
checking is enabled (the normal case), the AFS server processes running on
the machine verify that the issuer of a command meets its privilege
requirements. When authorization checking is disabled, server processes
perform any action for anyone, including the unprivileged user
C<anonymous>; this security exposure precludes disabling of authorization
checking except during installation or emergencies.

To indicate to the server processes that authorization checking is
disabled, the BOS Server creates the zero-length file
F</usr/afs/local/NoAuth> on its local disk. All AFS server processes
constantly monitor for the F<NoAuth> file's presence and do not check for
authorization when it is present. The BOS Server removes the file when
this command is used to re-enable authorization checking.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Do not create the F<NoAuth> file directly, except when directed by
instructions for dealing with emergencies (doing so requires being logged
in as the local superuser C<root>). Use this command instead.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to enable or disable authorization
checking. Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either
fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-authrequired> (on | off)

Enables authorization checking if the value is C<on>, or disables it if
the value is C<off>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example disables authorization checking on the machine
C<fs7.example.com>:

   % bos setauth -server fs7.example.com -authrequired off

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
