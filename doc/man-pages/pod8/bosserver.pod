=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bosserver command initializes the Basic OverSeer (BOS) Server
(B<bosserver> process). In the conventional configuration, the binary file
is located in the F</usr/afs/bin> directory on a file server machine.

The BOS Server must run on every file server machine and helps to automate
file server administration by performing the following tasks:

=over 4

=item *

Monitors the other AFS server processes on the local machine, to make sure
they are running correctly.

=item *

Automatically restarts failed processes, without contacting a human
operator. When restarting multiple server processes simultaneously, the
BOS Server takes interdependencies into account and initiates restarts in
the correct order.

=item *

Processes commands from the bos suite that administrators issue to verify
the status of server processes, install and start new processes, stop
processes either temporarily or permanently, and restart halted processes.

=item *

Manages system configuration information: the files that list the cell's
server encryption keys, database server machines, and users privileged to
issue commands from the B<bos> and B<vos> suites.

=back

The BOS Server is configured via the F<BosConfig> configuration file.
Normally, this file is managed via the B<bos> command suite rather than
edited directly.  See the L<BosConfig(5)> man page for the syntax of this
file.

The BOS Server will rewrite B<BosConfig> when shutting down, so changes
made manually to it will be discarded.  Instead, to change the BOS Server
configuration only for the next restart of B<bosserver>, create a file
named F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig.new>.  If B<BosConfig.new> exists when
B<bosserver> starts, it is renamed to F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig>,
removing any existing file by that name, before B<bosserver> reads its
configuration.

The BOS Server logs a default set of important events in the file
F</usr/afs/logs/BosLog>. To record the name of any user who performs a
privileged B<bos> command (one that requires being listed in the
F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file), add the B<-log> flag. To display the
contents of the B<BosLog> file, use the B<bos getlog> command.

The first time that the BOS Server initializes on a server machine, it
creates several files and subdirectories in the local F</usr/afs>
directory, and sets their mode bits to protect them from unauthorized
access. Each time it restarts, it checks that the mode bits still comply
with the settings listed in the following chart. A question mark indicates
that the BOS Server initially turns off the bit (sets it to the hyphen),
but does not check it at restart.

   /usr/afs              drwxr?xr-x
   /usr/afs/backup       drwx???---
   /usr/afs/bin          drwxr?xr-x
   /usr/afs/db           drwx???---
   /usr/afs/etc          drwxr?xr-x
   /usr/afs/etc/KeyFile  -rw????---
   /usr/afs/etc/UserList -rw?????--
   /usr/afs/local        drwx???---
   /usr/afs/logs         drwxr?xr-x

If the mode bits do not comply, the BOS Server writes the following
warning to the F<BosLog> file:

   Bosserver reports inappropriate access on server directories

However, the BOS Server does not reset the mode bits, so the administrator
can set them to alternate values if desired (with the understanding that
the warning message then appears at startup).

This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-noauth>

Turns off all authorization checks, and allows all connecting users to act as
administrators, even unauthenticated users. The use of this option is
inherently insecure, and should only be used in controlled environments for
experimental or debug purposes. See L<NoAuth(5)>.

=item B<-log>

Records in the F</usr/afs/logs/BosLog> file the names of all users who
successfully issue a privileged B<bos> command (one that requires being
listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file).

=item B<-cores=>none|<I<path>>

The argument none turns off core file generation. Otherwise, the
argument is a path where core files will be stored.

=item B<-auditlog> <I<log path>>

Turns on audit logging, and sets the path for the audit log.  The audit
log records information about RPC calls, including the name of the RPC
call, the host that submitted the call, the authenticated entity (user)
that issued the call, the parameters for the call, and if the call
succeeded or failed.

=item B<-audit-interface> (file | sysvmq)

Specifies what audit interface to use. Defaults to C<file>. See
L<fileserver(8)> for an explanation of each interface.

=item B<-enable_peer_stats>

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. For each connection with a specific UDP port on another machine,
a separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile, GetStatus, and
so on) sent or received. To display or otherwise access the records, use
the Rx Monitoring API.

=item B<-enable_process_stats>

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. A separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile,
GetStatus, and so on) sent or received, aggregated over all connections to
other machines. To display or otherwise access the records, use the Rx
Monitoring API.

=item B<-allow-dotted-principals>

By default, the RXKAD security layer will disallow access by Kerberos
principals with a dot in the first component of their name. This is to avoid
the confusion where principals user/admin and user.admin are both mapped to the
user.admin PTS entry. Sites whose Kerberos realms don't have these collisions 
between principal names may disable this check by starting the server
with this option.

=item B<-restricted>

In normal operation, the bos server allows a super user to run any command.
When the bos server is running in restricted mode (either due to this
command line flag, or when configured by L<bos_setrestricted(8)>) a number
of commands are unavailable. Note that this flag persists across reboots.
Once a server has been placed in restricted mode, it can only be opened up
by sending the SIGFPE signal.

=item B<-rxmaxmtu> <I<bytes>>

Sets the maximum transmission unit for the RX protocol.

=item B<-rxbind>

Bind the Rx socket to the primary interface only.  If not specified, the
Rx socket will listen on all interfaces.

=item B<-syslog>[=<I<facility>>]>

Specifies that logging output should go to syslog instead of the normal
log file.  B<-syslog>=I<facility> can be used to specify to which facility
the log message should be sent.

=item B<-transarc-logs>

Use Transarc style logging features. Rename the existing log file
F</usr/afs/logs/BosLog> to F</usr/afs/logs/BosLog.old> when the bos server is
restarted.  This option is provided for compatibility with older versions.

=item B<-pidfiles>[=<I<path>>]

Create a one-line file containing the process id (pid) for each non-cron
process started by the BOS Server.  This file is removed by the BOS Server when
the process exits.  The optional <I<path>> argument specifies the path where
the pid files are to be created.  The default location is C</usr/afs/local>.

The name of the pid files for C<simple> BOS Server process types are the BOS
Server instance name followed by C<.pid>.

The name of the pid files for C<fs> and C<dafs> BOS Server process types are
the BOS Server type name, C<fs> or C<dafs>, followed by the BOS Server core
name of the process, followed by C<.pid>.  The pid file name for the
C<fileserver> process is C<fs.file.pid>. The pid file name for the C<volserver>
is C<fs.vol.pid>.

BOS Server instance names are specfied using the B<bos create> command.  See
L<bos_create> for a description of the BOS Server process types and instance
names.

=item B<-nofork>

Run the BOS Server in the foreground. By default, the BOS Server process will
fork and detach the stdio, stderr, and stdin streams.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command initializes the BOS Server and logs the names of
users who issue privileged B<bos> commands.

   % bosserver -log

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer most be logged onto a file server machine as the local
superuser C<root>.
