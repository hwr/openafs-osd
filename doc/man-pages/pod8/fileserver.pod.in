=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fileserver> command initializes the File Server component of the
C<fs> process. In the conventional configuration, its binary file is
located in the F</usr/afs/bin> directory on a file server machine.

The B<fileserver> command is not normally issued at the command shell
prompt, but rather placed into a database server machine's
F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file with the B<bos create> command. If it is
ever issued at the command shell prompt, the issuer must be logged onto a
file server machine as the local superuser C<root>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following B<bos create> command creates a traditional fs process on
the file server machine C<fs2.example.com> that uses the large configuration
size, and allows volumes to exceed their quota by 10%. Type the command on
a single line:

   % bos create -server fs2.example.com -instance fs -type fs \
                -cmd "/usr/afs/bin/fileserver -pctspare 10 -L" \
                /usr/afs/bin/volserver /usr/afs/bin/salvager
