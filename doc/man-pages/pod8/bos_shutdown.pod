=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos shutdown> command stops, on the server machine named by the
B<-server> argument, either

=over 4

=item *

All of the currently running AFS server processes, except the BOS Server.

=item *

Only the processes specified by the B<-instance> argument.

=back

This command does not change a process's status flag in the
F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file, but only in the BOS Server's memory. To
stop a process and change its F<BosConfig> status flag, use the B<bos
stop> command instead.

Once stopped with this command, a process does not run again until an
administrator starts it by using the B<bos start>, B<bos startup>, or
B<bos restart> command, or until the BOS Server restarts (assuming that
the process's F<BosConfig> status flag is C<Run>).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to stop processes. Identify the
machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-instance> <I<instances>>+

Names each process to stop. Use the process name assigned with the
B<-instance> argument to the B<bos create> command. The output from the
B<bos status> command lists the names. Omit this argument to stop all
processes other than the BOS Server.

=item B<-wait>

Delays the return of the command shell prompt until all processes actually
stop. If this argument is omitted, the prompt returns almost immediately
even if all processes are not stopped.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command stops all processes other than the BOS Server on the
machine C<fs3.example.com>.

   % bos shutdown fs3.example.com

The following command stops the C<upserver> process (server portion of the
Update Server) on the machine C<fs5.example.com>.

   % bos shutdown -server fs5.example.com -instance upserver

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
