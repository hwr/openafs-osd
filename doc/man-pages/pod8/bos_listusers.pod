The B<bos listusers> command lists the user names from the
F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the file server machine named by the

To edit the list of users, use the B<bos adduser> and B<bos removeuser>
commands.

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine from which to display the UserList
file. Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either
fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see L<bos(8)>.

For consistent performance in the cell, the output must be the same on
every server machine. The B<bos adduser> reference page explains how to
keep the machines synchronized.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> or F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFileExt> file.
The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.
